Ahh, step 1. Don't you love a fresh start on a blank slate? And then selecting
that singular brick onto which you will build your entire palatial estate?

Unfortunately, when you're building a *computer program*, step 1 can get...
complicated. And frustrating. You have to make sure your environment is set up
for the programming language you're using, and you have to figure out how to
compile and run your program in that environment.

Fortunately, it's very fairly to set up a development environment with Rust, and
we won't be needing anything besides a text editor, `rust` and `cargo`. To
install these programs, we will be using a program called `rustup`, but there
are other ways available to get Rust up and running.

If you are using Linux, or any Unix-System including MacOS, just follow the
instructions below. If you are on Windows, you'll need access to a Linux system.
The easiest way is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which [is
available for Windows
10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). You can run and
install Rust on Windows, too, but you will soon run into issues while you are
following along this tutorial and won't be able to complete it.

> A lot has happened since this tutorial was published in 2019, and one of the
> changes is that for one of the libraries in this tutorial, there now exists
> an alternative that also runs on Windows machines. I will point out the alternative
> once we progress to that point, but this tutorial will still use the old library.

## How to install rust with `rustup`
If you visit the [rustup web site](https://rustup.rs/), it tries to auto-detect
your operating system and displays the best way to get rustup installed.
Usually, you download and execute a script, `rustup-init`, which does the
installation for you.

However, if downloading and executing a remote script is a red flag to you, you
can click on [other installation
options](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs/#other-installation-methods) and
download `rust-init` directly for your platform to start the installation.

### Finishing the installation on Linux, macOS or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
After the installation is done, the installer will tell you that it's finished
by printing:
```
Rust is installed now. Great!
```
To start using Rust, you either need to restart your terminal or type
```bash
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

### Adding a linker
Rust needs a linker of some kind to operate. It's likely that it's already
installed, but when you try to compile Rust problems and get errors telling you
that the linker could not be executed, you need to install one manually. C comes
with a correct linker, so it's worth following the [original
tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) on how to
install C.

### Check your installation
To verify that Rust has been installed correctly, run the following command:
```bash
$ rustc --version
```

For Cargo, run:
```bash
$ cargo --version
```
In both cases, you should see the program name, the version number and a few
other information. If not, please refer to the Installation chapter of the
[official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
to troubleshoot your installation.

## The main function
Go to a directory where you would like to start building and type

```bash
$ cargo init hecto
```

`hecto` is the name of the text editor we will be building. Executing this
command will create a folder called `hecto` which has already set up git (and
therefore includes a folder called `.git` and a file called `.gitignore`). We
are not going to use git for this tutorial, so you can ignore these two files
for the duration of this tutorial.

Let's take a look of what else has happened:

{% include hecto/initialization.html %}

<small>[See this step on
github](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/tree/initialization)</small>

Before we go into the details, let's first figure out what we are looking at.
This is a `diff`, and it shows you the changes between one code change and the
next. Below each step, you will find a link to this current step on Github,
where you can also browse the contents of other files at that point of the
tutorial. This is very useful in case you are lost.

Every diff tells you if files have been added, modified or deleted, and in case
of a modification, it shows deleted code in red, and added code in green.

As you can see from the diff, `cargo init` has created a file called
`Cargo.toml`, which is pre-filled with some pieces of information. More
specifically, the square brackets denote _sections_. The _dependencies_ section
below is empty, and the _package_ section contains:
- The name of the program, which defaults to the cargo package name.
- The current version of the program, which, by default, starts with `0.1.0`.
- A list of authors, which is in this case pre-filled with my name and mail
  address
- A field called `edition`, which tells rust which edition compiler should be
  used.

 If you are familiar with JavaScript, the `Cargo.toml` is comparable to the
 `package.json`. It describes your package as well as its dependencies to other
 packages.

Additionally, there is a file called `src/main.rs`, which already contains some
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

This code defines a function called `main`. The `main()` function is special. It
is the default starting point when you run your program. When you return from
the `main()` function, the program exits and passes the control back to the
operating system. Therefore, without any knowledge of Rust, we can infer that
this program [follows the ritual of the
ancients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) by printing
out "Hello, World!" and exiting. Let's see how we can run this.

Rust is a compiled language. That means we need to run our program through a
Rust compiler to turn it into an executable file. We then run that executable
like we would run any other program on the command line.

To compile `main.rs`, make sure you are in the `hecto` folder (Run `cd hecto`
after `cargo init hecto`), and then run `cargo build` in your shell. The output
will look similar to this:

```
    Compiling hecto v0.1.0 (/Users/flenker/Documents/Repositories/hecto)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45s
```
This will produce an executable named `hecto` and place it in a new folder
called `target/debug/`. Additionally, a new file will be created called
`Cargo.lock`. It is automatically generated and should not be touched. When we
add dependencies later to the project, the `Cargo.lock` will also be updated.
Its changes are not relevant to this tutorial and are therefore hidden from the
diffs.

If you look further at the contents of `target/debug`, you will find that
several more files have been generated.  These files are mostly needed by
`cargo`to make rebuilding the code more efficient (more on that in a second).
You won't need any of these files to run `hecto` except for the executable
itself, to run `hecto`, type  `./target/debug/hecto` (or `./hecto`, if you have
already navigated into `target/debug`) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The program
should output `Hello, world!` and then exit.

### Compiling and running
Since it's very common that you want to compile and run your program, rust
combines both steps with the command `cargo run`. If you run that command now
after `cargo build`, you might notice that the output changes a bit. It now
looks similar to this:

```
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/hecto`
Hello, world!
```
As you might have noticed, `cargo` does not output a line starting with
`Compiling`, as it did before. That it because rust can tell that the current
version of `main.rs` has already been compiled. If the `main.rs` was not
modified since the last compilation, then `rust` doesn’t bother running the
compilation again. If `main.rs` was changed, then `rust` re-compiles `main.rs`.
This is more useful for large projects with many different components to
compile, as most of the components shouldn’t need to be recompiled over and over
when you’re only making changes to one component’s source code.

Try changing the return value in `main.rs` to a string other than `Hello,
World`. Then run `cargo run`, and you should see it compile. Check the result to
see if you get the string you changed it to. Then change it back to `Hello,
World`, recompile,and make sure it's back to returning `Hello, World`.

After most steps in this tutorial, you will want to recompile the code, see if
it finds any errors in your code, and then run `hecto` by calling `cargo run`.
