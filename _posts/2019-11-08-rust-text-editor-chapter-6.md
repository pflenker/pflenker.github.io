Our text editor is done - we can open, edit and save files. The upcoming two
features add more functionality to it. In this chapter, we will implement a
minimal search feature.

For that, we reuse `prompt()`. When the user types a search query and presses
<kbd>Enter</kbd>, we'll loop through all the rows of our file, and if a row
contains their query string, we'll move the cursor to match. For that, we are
going to need a method which searches a single `Row` and returns the position of
the match. Let's start with that now.

{% include hecto/simple-search.html %}

<small>[See this step on
github](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/tree/simple-search)</small>

Let's go through this change starting at `Row`. We have added a function which
returns an `Option`, which contains either the x position of the match or
`None`. We then use the `find` method of `String` to retrieve the byte index of
the match. Remember that this might not be the same as the index of the
grapheme! To convert the byte index into the grapheme index, we use a slightly
convoluted loop. Let's unravel that one.

`grapheme_indices()` returns an iterator over a pair of `(byte_index, grapheme)`
for each grapheme in the string. `enumerate()` enumerates the iterator, so it
gives us the grapheme index of each entry of the iterator.

We take this to our advantage and use the iterator until we arrive at the
grapheme with the same byte index as our match, and return the corresponding
grapheme index.

In `Document`, we try to return a `Position` of the match within the full
document, if there is any. We do this by iterating over all rows and performing
`match` on each row, until we have a match. We then return the current row index
and the index of the match as the position of the match within the document.

In `Editor`, we use a very similar logic as before around `prompt`. We retrieve
the search query from the user and pass it to `find`. If we find a match, we
move our cursor. If we don't, we display a message to the user.

Last but not least, we also modify our initial welcome message for the user, so
that they know how to use our new search functionality.


## Incremental search

Now, let's make our search feature fancy. We want to support incremental search,
meaning the file is searched after each key press when the user is typing in
their search query.

To implement this, we're going to get `prompt` to take a callback function as an
argument. We'll have to call this function after each key press, passing the
current search query inputted by the user and the last key they pressed. I'll
explain the concept in a bit.

{% include hecto/incremental-search.html %}

<small>[See this step on
github](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/tree/incremental-search)</small>

We are using a new concept here called
[closures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/fn/closures.html). It comes
with a new bit of syntax, which makes this code a bit hard to read.

Let's start with the concept. What we want is to pass a _function_ to `prompt`,
and we want this function to be called every time the user has modified his
query. We want this so that we can perform a search on the partial query while
the user is typing.

How do we do that? First, we need to modify the signature for `prompt`. It now
looks like this:

```rust
 fn prompt<C>(&mut self, prompt: &str, callback: C) -> Result<Option<String>, std::io::Error> where C: Fn(&mut Self, Key, &String) {
     //...
 }
```

The initial `<C>` comes from the concept of Traits. We won't be implementing any
complex traits in the scope of this tutorial, so you won't be seeing this syntax
anywhere else. Essentially, the `C` is a placeholder for the callback, and you
can see it repeated as the type for the parameter `callback`. Another new thing
is the `where` at the end of the method definition, and this is where we define
what kind of function `C` should be. It should essentially take three
parameters: The `Editor`, the `Key` which has been pressed (we ignore it for
now, but we are going to use it later), and a `&String`, which will be the
(partial) search query. We can see `callback` being called with these parameters
after the user has pressed a key.

How do we define a callback? Well, we can see the easiest case in the `prompt`
for `save`: `|_, _, _| {}`.  This is a closure which takes three parameters,
ignores all of them and does nothing.

A more meaningful example is the addition to our Search-Prompt: Here, the
closure takes three parameters (ignoring the middle parameter) and actually does
something. As it's called with every partial query, we are performing  a search
and setting the cursor with every key press.

Maybe you are familiar with closures in other languages, and you might ask
yourself: Can't we just access `self` directly within the closure, instead of
passing it to `prompt` and then to the callback?

Well, yes and no. Yes, because a major feature of closures is that they allow
you to access variables from outside of the closure definition, but no, because
that does not work in this case.

The reason is that `prompt` takes a mutable reference to `self`, as it sets the
status message, and it would also pass a mutable reference to `callback`. That
is not allowed.

That’s all there is to it. We now have incremental search.

## Restore cursor position when cancelling search
If the user cancels his search, we want to reset the cursor to the old position.
For that, we are going to save the position before we start the `prompt`, and we
check the return value. If it's `None´, the user has cancelled his query, and we
want to restore his old cursor position and scroll to it.

{% include hecto/reset-position.html %}

<small>[See this step on
github](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/tree/reset-position)</small>

To clone the old position, we derive the Clone trait. This allows us to clone
all values of the `Position` struct by calling `clone`.

## Search forward and backward

The last feature we'd like to add is to allow the user to advance to the next or
previous match in the file using the arrow keys. The <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and
<kbd>&larr;</kbd> keys will go to the previous match, and the <kbd>&darr;</kbd>
and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> keys will go to the next match.

{% include hecto/navigate-right.html %}

<small>[See this step on
github](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/tree/navigate-right)</small>

We start by accepting a `start` position in our `find` methods, indicating that
we want to search the next match after that position. For `row`, this means that
we skip everything in the string up until `after` before performing `find`. We
need to add `after` to the grapheme index of the match, since the grapheme index
indicates the position in the substring without the first part of the string.

In `Document`, we are now skipping the first `y` rows when performing the
search. We then try to find a match in the current row with the current `x`
position. If we can't find anything, we proceed to the next line, but we set x
to 0 there, to make sure we start looking from the start of the next row.


We have adjusted our error message and are calling `find` now with the cursor
position. We are also now using the formerly unused `key` parameter of our
closure and match against the user input. If the user presses down or right, we
are moving the cursor to the right as well before continuing the search with the
updated parameter. Why? Because if our cursor is already at the position of a
search match, we don't want the current position to be returned to us, so we
start one step to the left of the current position. In case our find did not
return a match, we want the cursor to stay on its previous position. So we track
if we have moved the cursor in `moved` and move it back in case there is no
result.

## Searching backwards

Now let's take a look at searching backwards.

{% include hecto/navigate-left.html %}

<small>[See this step on
github](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/tree/navigate-left)</small>

That is quite a big change for something that should just be the opposite of
what we just implemented!

Let's unravel the change step by step, starting at `Row`.

We have renamed `after` to `at`, since we are not necessarily looking at
something after, but also before the given index. We are then calculating the
size of our substring which we want to search based on the search direction:
Either we want to search from the beginning to our current position, or from our
current position to the end of the row. Once we have the right length, we use an
iterator to collect our actual substring into a string. We allow integer
arithmetics here since we have made sure that end is always bigger than or equal
to start, and always smaller than or equal to the length of the current row.

You can see an enum in action: `SearchDirection`. We will see its definition in
a bit. For now, we use it to determine whether or not we should find the first
ocurrence in a given string, with `find`, or the last, with `rfind`. This
ensures that we are finding matches in the correct direction.

In `Document`, we are building our own iterator, since depending on the search
direction we either need to search forward or backward through the document.

We determine the range of rows through which we will be iterating based on the
search direction, and then we perform the search. Same as before: If we have a
match, then we can return the position we are currently on. If not, we have to
set `y` to the next or previous row, and have to set x either to 0, in case we
are searching forward, or to the length of the previous line, in case we are
searching backwards.

In `editor`, you can see the definition of our new struct, `SearchDirection`. It
derives `Copy` and `Clone`, which allows it to be passed around (the structure
is small enough that copying it instead of passing a reference does not really
matter), and `PartialEq` ensures that we can actually compare two search
directions to one another.

Then, we are defining a new variable, `direction`, which we intend to set from
within the `prompt` closure. We set the search direction to `backward` in case
the back or left key have been pressed, and to `forward` on right and down. Then
we pass the search direction to the adjusted `find` method.

Note that we also set the direction to forward again on any other keypress. If
we wouldn't do that, the search behavior would be weird: Let's say the cursor
is on `baz` of `foo bar baz`, the user has entered `b` and the Search Direction
is backward. If you typed `a`, the query would be `ba` and the user would jump
back to `bar` instead of staying on `baz`, even though `baz` also matches the
query.

We have also removed the final search and the "Not found" message in case the
user cancels the search. We are already searching within the closure, so an
additional search at the end does not bring us any benefit.

Last but not least, we needed to update the signature for our callback (and
thus, for `prompt`), so that `callback` is able to modify variables accessed
within it. That's being done by changing `callback` to `FnMut`.

Congratulation, our search feature works now!

## Conclusion
Since our functionality is now complete, we used this chapter again to focus a
bit more on Rust topics and brushed the topic of Closures and Traits. Our editor
is almost complete - in the [next chapter]({% post_url
2019-11-08-rust-text-editor-chapter-7%}), we are going to implement Syntax
Highlighting and File Type Detection, to complete our text editor.
