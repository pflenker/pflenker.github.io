It's a few days old already, but [CTRL-SHIFT-FACE has posted an impressive set of deep fakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx59bskG8dc) , starring Jim Carrey in _Shining_, and showing off the current state of the art for Deep Fakes. Spooky.

Contrast [Bruce Lee's Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2mwz_cnAIk), which is not as convincing - you can see the fake transitioning back and forth between Keanu and Bruce.

All Episodes of Jim Carrey's Shining:
- [Episode 1 - Concentration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_NZpkttXE)
- [Episode 2 - The Bat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZRUZzZPGto)
- [Episode 3 - Here's Jimmy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx59bskG8dc)
- [Episode 4 - The Maze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlvoEW7l5rs)
