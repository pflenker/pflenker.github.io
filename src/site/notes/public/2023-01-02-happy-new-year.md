# New Year Resolutions & Announcements
<p><span>📆 <code>Monday, January 2, 2023</code></span></p>
#Misc

Happy new year 2023! The blog has been pretty inactive for quite some time, and my New Year's Resolution is to change that and make it more active. At the same time, I have reduced my Social Media presence, so I took some time and cleaned up my blog, removed all references to Twitter and Instagram and made the page actually look more like a blog than anything else.  

At the same time, I am going to abandon my tutorial for [[public/2022-04-01-konzept-introduction\|Konzept]]. Back when I wrote it, I was very much in the flow, but then - alas, the Ukraine war forced many people to leave the country, and we took in some refugees for a couple of months. This has shaken up our lives quite a bit, and now I find myself completely out of any flow, with only cryptical notes to self and a Konzept repo that is horribly outdated. So I am not going to continue it any further.

Following [this article on The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging), I also would like to give more room to geeky, nerdy and overall _random_ stuff - just as we all did back in the late 90s/early 2000s, when we didn't call it "a blog", but "our website". So expect some mildly interesting stuff in the future.
