3 years ago, DALL-E was really popular as one of the first widely available AIs capable of creating images. The concept of AI was so new that we needed to learn to actually use it - to prompt it in a way that it produces the desired output. This seemed like such a mysterious art back then that for a short time, people believed that "Prompt Engineer" will be a job in its own right within a year or two.[^1]

Back then, I created [[public/202513-051436-96\|Hotel DALL-E Fornia]], which is now a great showcase not only of the abilities AI had back then, but also of my abilities to get the AI to produce something meaningful.

In the past 3 years, both AIs and myself have taken leaps and bounds in our respective capabilities. So without further ado, I am proud to present to you:[^2]

## Gemini feat. Philipp Flenker: Hotel DALL-E Fornia (2025 Remix)

_On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair…_

_…warm smell of Colitas - rising up through the air…_

_…Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light…_

_…My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim - I had to stop for the night…_

_…There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell…_

_…and I was thinking to myself: “This could be heaven or this could be hell”…_

_…Then she lit up the candle, and she showed me the way…_

_…there were voices down the corridor, thought I heard them say:_

_Welcome to the Hotel California!_
