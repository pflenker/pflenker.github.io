#leadership
I found a term for the kind of leadership style I prefer: Red Carpeting.

In this leadership style, it's the lead's responsibility to roll out the red carpet, ensure everything is in place, so that the stars can shine.

The metaphor of a lead being akin to a director for a stage play really resonates with me - because it's the job of the director to ensure everyone can perform to the best of their abilities, while they are not at the front and center of the stage as the play is performed. However, "directing" is a buzz word full of ambiguous meaning, which is why I like red carpeting a bit better.

The people responsible for the Red Carpet are also responsible for creating an environment in which the stars can move freely, their needs are catered to, but they are also not wandering into off-bounds parts of the event by mistake. This is the kind of boundary and rule setting I think we all should expect from a lead.
