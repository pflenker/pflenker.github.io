Having two people casually talking about their childhood experiences in one of the most exciting and beloved centuries - what a great idea! Too bad it wasn't mine, but the idea behind a podcast called [Young in the
80s](http://younginthe80s.de/). I loved the idea a lot and wished there was something similar for the 90s - so I reached out to the creators of Young in the 80s and asked them for permission to use their idea for a 90s related podcast.
Luckily, they agreed!

## Venturing Into Podcasts
The year was 2014,[^1] and I convinced my best friend to create a podcast around how we
perceived growing up in the 90s. We had a lot of fun recording the episodes and remembering the good times of the past while preparing for it.

Back then, podcasts already had a huge audience,[^2] and our rather modest level of professionalism fit right in with other podcasts of that era.[^3]

## Podcasting Takes Time
We ended the project due to time constraints. Preparing, recording, post-processing, community work - all this is time-consuming, so we ended it and withdrew the episodes from the podcast hosting services. However, all episodes are still available here:

- [Episode 1: Sammlerstücke](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_1_Sammlerstuecke.mp3)
- [Episode 2: Trickserien](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_2_Trickserien.mp3)
- [Episode 3: Das Internet](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_3_Das_Internet.mp3)
- [Episode 4: Gameshows](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_4_Gameshows.mp3)
- [Episode 5: Gegenrede](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_5_Gegenrede.mp3)
- [Episode 6: Popmusik](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_6_Popmusik.mp3)
- [Episode 7: Computerspiele](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_7_Computerspiele.mp3)
- [Episode 8: Silvester](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_8_Silvester.mp3)
- [Episode 9: Mode](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_9_Mode.mp3)
- [Episode 10: Ein Tag in den 90ern](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_10_Ein_Tag_in_den_90ern.mp3)
- [Episode 11: Comedy](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_11_Comedy.mp3)
- [Episode 12: Star Trek](http://stuff.philippflenker.com/90srewind/Episode_12_Star_Trek.mp3)

[^1]: Back then, we thought the trend was already over and we're basically jumping on a dead medium. Don't trust me on tech trends.
[^2]: Probably not in comparison to today, but we considered the numbers insanely huge. Honestly, I thought the numbers must've been wrong and didn't pay attention to them - until someone recognised my voice during a webinar I gave at work.

[^3]: I sometimes wonder how much of a following our podcast would have if we continued it until today. Maybe we shouldn't have limited it to the 90s.
