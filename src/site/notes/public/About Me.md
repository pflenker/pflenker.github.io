This is the one big place where I can put everything about me, without having to tailor it for others (think professional networks) or otherwise worry about usefulness. I’ve been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/about) and treat this page as my own mini-autobiography.

## I am Restless
I can’t stay still for too long. I love diving down rabbit holes, but I quickly get bored at the bottom of it and move on. I try directing this energy into something meaningful, but that doesn’t always work. If at the bottom of a rabbit hole lies an immersive story, or an intellectually enticing problem, I’d jump in head-first. I have a long list of abandoned projects, and for a long time I regarded my inability to finish any of these as a flaw. I made peace with this, though, and seek no longer achievements or glory with my projects. I've put up something I call a [[public/pet-project-sematary\|Pet Project Sematary]] where I put my pet projects to rest.

## I Fear Becoming an Addict
At one point in my life, I shared a place with a man who was addicted to online gaming. He would stay up until late to perform raids in Earth and Beyond, and when I got up in the morning I saw him asleep in front of his desk, his head on the keyboard. And I thought: this could be me. Given how easy it is for me to dive down interesting rabbit holes, I avoid anything that is designed to drag me down and never let me out. This includes smoking, drinking, gaming, gambling, eating, you name it. I consider myself lucky to possess abysmal gaming skills and little patience to go beyond a tutorial that is only slightly longer than usual.

## I Don’t Care Much about Money
I subscribe to the idea that money is a hygiene factor: like hygiene (think cleanliness in a hotel room), you expect a certain degree, but there is a ceiling after which you don’t mind how much cleaner it is. Given that my initial salary already surpassed the combined income of my parents at their peak, my ceiling is pretty modest.  I can already afford more I ever dreamed of, and my wife and I able to offer a life to our kids where they are not lacking a thing.

## The Imposter Syndrome and Dunning-Kruger Sometimes Describe me Pretty Well
Every now and then, I question my own abilities and feel that I faked it to where I am right now, and if people just looked a bit closer at who I was and what I did, they would surely find out and everything would fall apart. That’s called the [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).  
Also every now and then, I unironically think I’m the smartest person in the room, and that I know better than even objectively more experienced people. I have suffered a couple epic and cringeworthy failures due to that.  That’s called the [Dunning-Kruger-Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
Perhaps the latter feeds the former, I don’t know.

## My Atheism is a Strong Opinion, Loosely Held
I am neither superstitious nor religious. I don’t think it’s possible to “jinx it”, I don’t wish upon a star, and there is no otherworldly being watching over us. I follow Buddhist teachings only in the most worldly interpretations, including Karma and Rebirth, and recommend reading [What the Buddha Taught.](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/What-Buddha-Taught-Expanded-Dhammapada/dp/0802130313)
I do acknowledge and sometimes admire the fulfillment religion brings to some people and sometimes wish I had the same to fall back to. But I also draw strength out of the fact that I built everything on my own, the good and the bad, with no one else to blame but myself.
At the same time, and I don’t mean to be condescending, all it takes is one inexplicable genuine occurrence to convince me of the opposite. But if said otherworldly being requires me to not use the scientific rigor and logical thinking it supposedly gifted me with in order to believe, then I’d have to pass.

## Other Things About Me:
- **I abhor lying**, almost to a fault. This includes white lies or innocent ones, like pretending Santa exists. I’m not a bad liar though, quite the opposite.
- **I rarely regret things**. Taking a decision implies uncertainty (otherwise there would be nothing to decide), and more often than not any decision is better than no decision. I made decisions which in hindsight turned out to be wrong, but I rarely regret taking that decision. It seemed best based on what I knew when I took it, and that’s enough.
- **High tech fascinates me**. I am constantly amazed at the marvels of modern technology and have no qualms using all the latest gadgets I can get my fingers on, privacy or security be damned. The future is now.
- **Low tech doesn’t scare me**. I spent lots of time outside in my teenager years, hiking and in tents, with limited or no access to electricity or running water for days. With 16, I hiked 180km through Germany only because someone on the internet told me he didn’t believe I could. Despite all my work and most of my entertainment being online, even an extended blackout wouldn’t worry me.
