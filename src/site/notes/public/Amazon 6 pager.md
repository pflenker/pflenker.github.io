Amazon is famous for being a document driven company. 6-Pagers are specific part of this:
- **1-Pagers** are designed to give a high-level overview over something, including background, opportunity, next steps.
- **6-Pagers** expand on this and explain a project or plan, i.e. by presenting a consolidated result of a deep dive.
More details on this [here](https://www.larksuite.com/en_us/blog/amazon-6-pager).

This came back to my attention while listening to an [Interview with Dave Anderson](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/working-at-amazon-as-a-software-engineer) from Amazon. I'm adding this here to act as a reminder to myself to stick to 6 pages ==or less==. My current employer, Zalando, is quite document-driven, too - but sometimes we miss out on keeping our docs short.
