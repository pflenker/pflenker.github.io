# Humble Beginnings

#running

At the time of writing in 2025, I [[public/Running\|run]] around 40 km per week, and whenever this hobby comes up, people tend to assume it has always been like this. But the opposite is true - it has been a long way to where I am right now.

I remember my earliest attempt to start running as a hobby. I bought some running shoes, my first-ever running shirt, and I made the following plan: I would leave my apartment, go across the parking lot to the street, and from that street run a short track of around 100 meters across the next corner and back. I wanted to start small and not over-exert myself.

However, I underestimated just _how_ un-fit I was. I didn't even make it across the parking lot without side stitches and profuse sweating, and when I arrived at the start of my track, I was completely exhausted. I turned around and walked back home, convinced that running just was not for me.[^1]
