This page is dedicated to my current website setup, my customizations, bugs, rough edges which still exist and potential workarounds.

## The Setup
- I write texts within [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).
- I use the plugin [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev), which publishes notes of my choosing firstly into a GitHub Repository.
- Said repo is derived from [this template](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden), which houses an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) project.
- 11ty produces a static page which is then deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://www.11ty.dev).

## Issues, Bugs and Customisations
Here I track any issues I've encountered so far and how I deal with them.

Whenever possible, I want to fix issues directly in Obsidian, so that my Obsidian view of the texts I publish stays close to what is actually produced.
The next best thing is to customize the Digital Garden template [the way it's meant to be customized](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/), to avoid hassle when updating the template in the future. If the customization options are not sufficient, I look next at fixing this in the files outside of the customization paths in the template, which comes at the price of overhead when updating the template.
If it's not fixable in the template, the last resort is fixing this in the plugin directly.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages
**Status:** Resolved ‚úÖ

**Description:** The plugin is [mainly aimed at Vercel](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/01-getting-started/), and lists Github Pages only [somewhere in the "Other" section](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/hosting-alternatives/). There is no documentation on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.

**Solution:**
- Clone the [Template Repository](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden). It needs to be public, and it needs to be named `(yourname).github.io` as per the [GitHub Pages Documentation.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
- Follow the set up of the Digital Garden plugin to connect Obsidian to that repository.
- In the repository settings, under "Pages", finish the setup of the page. As "Source", select "GitHub Actions".
- If GitHub comes with its own workflow, remove it (you can do this in the Actions tab in GitHub). You should also remove the build workflow the template comes with by deleting `.github/workflows/build.yaml` from the repository.
- Place the `main.yaml` from below into `.github/workflows/` to activate the workflow that builds the site.
- **Done!**

> [!example]- `main.yaml`
>  ```
> name: GH Pages
> 
> on:
>   push:
>     branches:
>       - main  # Set a branch name to trigger deployment
>   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
>   workflow_dispatch:      
>   pull_request:
> permissions:
>   contents: read
>   pages: write
>   id-token: write

>   group: "pages"
>   cancel-in-progress: false  
> jobs:
>   deploy:
>     environment:
>       name: github-pages
>       url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
>     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

>         with:
>           node-version: '23'
>         
>       - run: npm install
>       - run: npm run build 
>       - name: Setup Pages

>           path: 'dist'
>       - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

### 404 Pages don't work properly
**Status**: Resolved ‚úÖ

**Description:** For internal broken links, the Digital Garden links correctly to its 404 page. For invalid URLs, the default GitHub Pages 404 is displayed.

**Solution:** Add the following front matter to the `src/site/404.njk`:

```
---
permalink: 404.html 
---
```

### Formatting breaks if there is no line break above a heading
**Status:** Worked around ‚úÖ

**Description:** Obsidian renders just fine if you put content directly above a heading, but formatting for a Digital Garden note breaks in this case.

**Solution:** I am using [Obsidian Linter anyways](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) , so all I had to do was to enable the rule ["Heading Blank Lines"](https://platers.github.io/obsidian-linter/settings/spacing-rules/#heading-blank-lines). This prevents the offending formatting from happening.

### Inefficient Transclusions
**Status:** Worked around ‚úÖ

**Description:** The plugin doesn't cache transclusions, so if you transclude e.g. a header in every note, then that header file is compiled for every single note again. This results in performance degradation during publishing.

**Solution:** Using transclusions as a header has other drawbacks as well, such as the header showing up in the RSS Feed or the built-in search. The Digital Garden plugin has a [capability to add custom components, such as a Header](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/), which I used instead of transclusions.

### Regular Dataviews produce bogus output
**Status:** Worked around ‚úÖ

**Description:** Dataviews sometimes produce a single `{ .block-language-dataview}`  below the desired result.

**Solution:** I migrated to JS Dataviews first, but I ran into performance issues. Instead, I now remove that line during markdown pre-processing. I do this by extending the `userMarkdownSetup` in the template file `src/helpers/userSetup.js`  as follows:

```JavaScript
function preProcessRule(state) {
    let currentContent = state.src;
    currentContent = currentContent
                        .split('\n')
	                    .filter(line => 
	                        !line
	                            .trim()
	                            .startsWith('{ .block-language-dataview}'))
                                .join('\n');
    state.src = currentContent;
  }
  md.core.ruler.before('normalize', 'user_markdown_preprocessor', preProcessRule);
```

This removes the offending line.

### JS Dataviews have performance issues
**Status:** Partially Resolved ‚è≥

**Description:** JS Dataviews come with a significant performance overhead, as a JS environment needs to be spun up for every note that uses one. I had JS Dataviews in every file, which increased the compile time (needed for publishing) from seconds to minutes.

**Solution**: since most of these dataviews were built to create some kind of header or footer, I replaced most of them with custom components, as described above. There are still some dataviews remaining that I need to migrate.

### Opening the Publication Center on Mobile sometimes causes an app reload
**Status:** Watching üëÄ

**Description:** Pretty much what it says on the tin.

**Solution:** My current assumption is that this is due to the performance issues caused by DataviewJS and that this issue will go away once I solve these performance bottlenecks.

### The first `---` below the front matter is not rendered
**Status:** Resolved ‚úÖ

**Description**: In any markdown file, the first line below the front matter which only contains `---` will disappear instead of rendering a horizontal line.

**Solution:** This is because of the following setting in the template's `eleventy.js`:

```JavaScript
 eleventyConfig.setFrontMatterParsingOptions({
   excerpt: true
  });
```

This treats the first `---` as a signal that everything between the front matter and this separator should be made available as an excerpt, and the `---` is then removed. This can be solved, while retaining the functionality, by changing the options as follows:

```javascript
eleventyConfig.setFrontMatterParsingOptions({
   excerpt: true,
   excerpt_separator: "<!-- excerpt -->"   
});
```

This makes 11ty use the given separator, keeping the `---` intact.

### `dv.current()` is empty in inline dataview JS queries
**Status:** Worked Around ‚úÖ

**Description:** Using `dv.current()` to access the current file in an inline dataview JS query renders just fine in Obsidian but the result is empty on compiling.

**Solution:** My first solution was to use `dv.pages()` in combination with [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html) to get what I wanted. But given the performance issues I observed with dataview as well as the locale issues with Dataview,  I decided to move away from js dataviews. Since I used them effectively for values that belong into the header and footer, I was able to get rid of them by moving that rendering logic to 11ty.

### Dates are parsed inconsistently across devices
**Status:** Worked around ‚úÖ

**Description:** Using dataview to parse dates in a specific format yields to inconsistent results across devices. This is actually an issue with DataView, as on iOS, it uses the locale based on the system device settings for formatting instead of a locale based on the language Obsidian is in. DataView's documentation even states that formatting might have locale issues.

**Solution:** As mentioned in other sections as well, I was using this functionality mainly to replicate header/footer functionality. I moved this to 11ty.

### Unnamed links are not supported
**Status:** Not a Bug

**Description:** Links without a title in the form of `[[note-name]]` are ignored by the plugin.

**Solution:** Works as intended, and since I don't need this feature, I haven't invested in fixing this.

### Links to headers in the same file are not supported
**Status:** Resolved ‚úÖ

**Description:** A link to a heading in the same file, as in: `[[#Unnamed links are not supported|A link to the previous section]]` is not supported and leads to dead links.

**Solution:** In `getAnchorAttributes()` within the `.eleventy.js`, check if `fileName` is empty and if so, set `permalink` to `""` right away instead of attempting to load the file. Lo and behold: [[#Unnamed links are not supported|A link to the previous section]].

### Other Issues
These are other issues I encountered. I will expand on all of them once I find the time.

- Feed and Sitemap producing invalid output
- built-in header components (timestamp, tags, H1) have issued
- secondary rate limit hit on publishing many files
- Kebab-case front matter not recognized
- The permalink needs to stay stable even If the title isn‚Äôt
- compile fails if permalink is number
- I want to see the title in my file, but the setup prevents me to do so
- Linking to header in same note doesn‚Äôt work
- Callout "names" are visible in search
