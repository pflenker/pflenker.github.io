#ProductOwnership #ProductOwnerQA

![teaching.png](/img/user/attachments/teaching.png)
As part of a long-running Product Owner training I hosted, I was offering a Lean Coffee where every participant could ask questions and bring challenges, which would then be discussed and answered by the full group.

I have captured a few questions and the replies here:

- [[public/Why prioritize?\|Why prioritize?]]
- [[public/What's the use of the team self-organizing their work if the solution is clear?\|What's the use of the team self-organizing their work if the solution is clear?]]
- [[public/How to sync information between teams?\|How to sync information between teams?]]
- [[public/How strictly should we stick to the rules of Scrum and Kanban?\|How strictly should we stick to the rules of Scrum and Kanban?]]
- [[public/When or how often should you change your product vision?\|When or how often should you change your product vision?]]
