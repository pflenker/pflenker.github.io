> [!question]- What's a Blip?
> **Short answer:**
> [[public/blips/20250428204625\|This is a blip.]]
> **Long answer:**
> I've moved away from doomscrolling and pretty much every social network out there. But I still like the idea of microblogging - that's what a blip is: my own little tweet, skeet, toot or however it is named out there.
