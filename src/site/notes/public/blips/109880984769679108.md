2-week-sprints come from a time where feedback loops where in the area of months, or even years. In a world where a project needs 6 months of  specification before starting to involve developers, this was revolutionary and new.
These days things are very different, and I find the notion of a maximum of 14 days between implementation and feedback from stakeholders very odd. #extremeprogramming
