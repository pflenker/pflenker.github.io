German copyright law really needs an overhaul - if you Nair photos of your place and post them online - for example when you want to rent your place - you need to ask the author of any visible photographic wallpaper for permission. Otherwise you need to pay up. [heise.de/news/Urteil-Fototapetâ€¦](https://www.heise.de/news/Urteil-Fototapete-in-Gaestezimmer-als-Urheberrechtsverletzung-7524441.html)
