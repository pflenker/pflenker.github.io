> So there was a mass shooting at a sect in Germany. Prior to the shooting, someone told the police the guy would be unstable, and had written a book and published it on his home page with worrying contents. Turns out: The police googled '<name of the shooter> book' and did not find any results, then ended their investigation.
> So if you have something to hide, just put it on the front page of your home page!
