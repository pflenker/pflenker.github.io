> [!summary] **philipp**:
>
> It just occurred to me how dumb it is to save for a driver's license for my kids and nephews. Not because it's not useful, but because it underlinies how 'special' driving is, even though it's not good for the climate.
> So here is my change of plans:
> 1) The money they will get does not come with the expectation to buy a driver's license, they can buy anything they like from it
> 2) Additionally, I will save up some more money to buy them an interrail ticket each.
