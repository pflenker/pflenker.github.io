One of my all-time favourites, ever, is Illusion of Time (Released as Illusion of Gaia in the US). It's comparatively easy, which made it very accessible to me when I was a kid.
What makes this game remarkable is just how much effort it dedicates to telling its story. Sure, it's got lots of awesome fantastic stuff going on - but it's also incredibly strong in telling stories about relationship among the main characters.
