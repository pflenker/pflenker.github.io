I don't get it. Todo Lists gotta be one of the top use cases to use AI for - to expand on existing Todos, to try and extract importance and to resurface tasks which might fall through the cracks otherwise.
But all the AI powered to do lists seem to be capable of is: finding an empty slot in my calendar and book it so that I can work on todos there.
