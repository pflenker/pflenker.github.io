> Small rant: My dryer has one button to start. You press it, it beeps once, it starts.
> But if you press it not long enough, it doesn't start.
> The infuriating thing is: It beeps twice. So it knows I pressed it. It knows I want to start drying. But it wants me to press again - but to do it _right_ this time.
> What a dick reincarnated as a dryer.
