> For a long time, I assumed that the Internet has only vanished into walled gardens, like Instagram, and that all the fun that used to be everywhere is happening there.
> Now I took a closer look at these walled gardens again and found that they are also empty - the same 5 jokes repeated endlessly over and over again, hate speech and nothing else.
> I am usually not someone to cling to the past, but I do miss the 'old internet'.
