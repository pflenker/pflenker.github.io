Let me tell you youngsters a bit about home screens. When the first #Xbox launched, it booted directly to the game that was in the disc drive - as did all the consoles back then. The Home Screen was completely useless (And also had some eerie music in it, wtf). The 360 started out with the same, but at some point extended the experience massively from the snappy Blades design to an ever-loading more bloated view. Since online gaming was rare, streaming not a thing and the Xbox unusable as a dvd drive unless you bought an extra piece of hardware, the dashboard was mostly annoying. These days elaborate dashboards are everywhere, shoving ads down our throats, but also looking much nicer than they used to. I feel todayâ€˜s Xbox dashboard is much closer to the initial one or the blades - staying out of the way unless needed - thanany of the intermediate steps.
