> [Software Architecture is overrated, clear and simple design is underrated](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-architecture-is-overrated/). This article resonates with me because I have worked with multiple teams before, with different emphasis on architecture, and I - from my anecdotal experience at least - do not think that investing more in upfront architecture is really making the software better in the long run. If you are factoring in the time to refactor as you go, and are working with skilled engineers, minimizing the upfront architecture work and focussing on clear and simple design is the key.
