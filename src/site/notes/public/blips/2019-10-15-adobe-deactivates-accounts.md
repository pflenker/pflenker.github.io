> The future is now: [Adobe deactivates subscriptions for Venezuela](https://mobile.twitter.com/mrmedina/status/1181348462639452160). Adobe is mainly offering subscription-only products, with very limited options in case you want to buy instead of subscribe to a product. Also, they are not giving refunds to the holders of the cancelled subscriptions.
