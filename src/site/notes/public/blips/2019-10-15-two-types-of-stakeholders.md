> [Arvind Narayanan on why enterprise software sucks](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/1182635589604171776).

> The fact that people who are buying the software are not always the people who are using the software is a fundamental truth that has a direct impact on the motivation of developers. I have seen many people run into a trap of developing a "user friendly software" without an understanding about who is actually buying the software. It can be very frustrating putting a lot of effort into a fancy dashboard no one uses as opposed to improving the parts of the software the users are frequently using.
