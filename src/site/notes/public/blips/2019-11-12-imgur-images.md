> consensus in the thread was that the engineers at Imgur need to be morons in
> order to let something like this happen.

> My take on this is that it has grown organically. Imgur is not interested in
> making the mobile experience (that's what this is about) great, they want you to
> use the app instead. Coincidentally, the "Download the app" button is among the
> first elements to be rendered. My best guess is that the current mobile page is
> just something cobbled together on top of old software, with the business people
> breathing down the developer's neck.
