> It started with [Nandi covering Everlong by the Foo Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRvHI8tgx8A), to which Dave [responded with a challenge to cover Dead End Friends by Them Crooked  Vultures](https://twitter.com/foofighters/status/1299740995538485248). Nandi [executed this challenge beautifully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZBQW2gE0Ew&list=PL0B-SSjYdybBRF4tbXLAl4WDBhOQbydod&index=3), and then Grohl [wrote a song just for her](https://twitter.com/foofighters/status/1305517568946438144).
