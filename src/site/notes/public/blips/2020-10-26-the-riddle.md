> video:
>
> > A father is about to bring his son to a job interview, applying for a position
> > at a large stockbrokers company in the city. Just as they arrive at the
> > company's parking lot, the son's phone rings. He looks at his father, who
> > says: "Go ahead, answer it."  
> > The caller is the trading company's CEO who says: "Good luck son, you've got
> > this."  
> > The son ends the call and once again looks at his father, who is still next to
> > him in their car.
> >
> > How is this possible?
