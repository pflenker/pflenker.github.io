[A short riddle to test how biased you
are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kFC7669quE) Telling you more about it
would kind of give it away. Here is the riddle as text, the solution is in the
video:

> A father is about to bring his son to a job interview, applying for a position
> at a large stockbrokers company in the city. Just as they arrive at the
> company's parking lot, the son's phone rings. He looks at his father, who
> says: "Go ahead, answer it."  
> The caller is the trading company's CEO who says: "Good luck son, you've got
> this."  
> The son ends the call and once again looks at his father, who is still next to
> him in their car.

> How is this possible?
