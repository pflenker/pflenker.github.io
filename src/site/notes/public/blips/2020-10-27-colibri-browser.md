> [Colibri is a browser without tabs.](https://colibri.opqr.co/) It offers two
> replacement concepts:
>
> - Links, which is essentially a list of interesting links. Instead of opening a
> new tab, you would place the existing one here.
> - Lists, which helps you grouping links.
> 
> I like the idea a lot and think that it has a lot of potential - I agree that
> the idea of tabs needs overhauling. However, I disagree with the implementation
> so far. Colibri lacks many basic features, which I would find acceptable in an
> MVP.  
> But their key features, Links and Lists, are hard and not intuitive to use, and
> the current feature set for these features are not very satisfying, considering
> that this is supposed to be the unique selling point of this browser.
>
> Nice idea, needs more work.
