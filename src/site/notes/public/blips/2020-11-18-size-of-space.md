[Great visualization of how big space is.](https://neal.fun/size-of-space/)

> “Space is big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.”
> --Douglas Adams, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
