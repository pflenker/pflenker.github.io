Interesting article on [reverse engineering the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine.](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/)
I have a background in Biology and Bioinformatics, so I feel quite at home in this article, and I appreciate how the author took their time to break this all down.
