> Currently, this [post about how shoddy code causes 6 minute long loading times in a game](https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/index.html) is going around. I think this is an interesting case, because it underlines the fact that if you are selling goods which are exceptionally high in demand, and for which there is no competition, then you can drastically save on quality. And that includes customers having to suffer minute-long loading times, either because no one noticed, or, more likely, no one cared.
