> I will try to do the same now with my iPhone, by:
>
> - Deleting Twitter and Instagram
> - Removing everything from the home screen except the apps that I actually frequently use
> - Removing all widgets from the home screen
> - Setting "discrete" notifications to "off"
> - Disabling notifications for most apps except for my work chat and work mail program, as well as the messenger where I stay connected to my family
> - Scheduling D&D mode from 1 hour after work to 1 hour before work
> - Disabling notifications on the lock screen
> 
> I will try this out for one week and see how it goes!
