How to set a narrative without facts (all links in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, sorry!):

Part I: The police complains loudly about attacks on New Year's Eve, without providing any numbers at all. Basically, they are just complaining.

Part II: Jens Spahn [claims](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/deutschland/innenpolitik/id_100104984/spahn-gescheiterte-integration-fuer-silvesterkrawalle-mitverantwortlich.html) that "unregulated migration" is to blame. Again, no proof. Which is ironic since he was part of the government that was in charge until very recently, and while migration to Germany was at an all-time high.

Part III: tagesschau takes the unfounded complaints and unproven statements and [speculates about the reasons](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/silvester-gewalt-gegen-polizisten-101.html), even quoting psychologists that give their assessment based on assumptions on top of assumptions.

And now we talk about immigration and migration again. Meanwhile,the police finally released more concrete numbers (reducing their initial assessment) and nationalities ([18 different nationalities, with Germans being the biggest group](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/45-von-145-festgenommenen-sind-deutsche-alle-mutmasslichen-silvester-randalierer-wieder-frei--berliner-polizei-veroffentlicht-zahlen-9120553.html)).

**Addendum**:
[Here's a much more nuanced article on that matter](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2023-01/silvester-randale-berlin-taeter-herkunft-folgen), which points out - among other things - that crimes committed by immigrants is on the decline, and that this whole thing might be due to toxic masculinity more than anything else.

**Addendum**:
The number went down again, now we're [talking about 38 people, the majority of them German.](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neue-zahlen-zu-berliner-silvester-krawallen-nur-38-festgenommene-wegen-boller-attacken--mehrheitlich-deutsche-9147513.html). Seems like the police simply lied, and given how trustworthy the police is, most people, including Germans, believed this.

Small detail: In many media outlets, the [outrage is free](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/kriminalitaet-berlin-senat-grossteil-der-taeter-von-silvester-unbekannt-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-230111-99-184657) with the wrong, uncorrected numbers being freely available online, while the [truth is behind a paywall.](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/medien/polizei-silvester-berlin-pressearbeit-1.5730395?reduced=true)
