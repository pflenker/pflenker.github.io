> [Shopify is doubling down on useless meetings.](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/03/tech/shopify-meetings/index.html) I welcome that - there are multiple factors that lead to meetings with too many people:
>
> - Lack of clarity about who needs to be involved, so people invite more, just to be sure
> - Fear of missing out, so people join meetings just in case
> - Lack of clarity about what is going on in a meeting, so people join meetings just to find out in the middle that they can neither contribute nor learn
> - And, of course, Meetings that should have been emails.
