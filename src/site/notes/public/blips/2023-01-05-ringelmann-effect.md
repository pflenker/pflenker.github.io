> I know the general push for smaller teams - e.g. the [Two Pizza Rule](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/two-pizza-rule) or the [7 +/- 2 Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two), but until now I assumed this was only to minimize communication paths within the team. Turns out there is another effect at play: [The Ringelmann Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect):
>
> > The Ringelmann effect is the tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases. [...] As more people are involved in a task, their average performance decreases, each participant tending to feel that their own effort is not critical.
