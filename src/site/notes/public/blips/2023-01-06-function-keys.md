> [You're using Function Keys wrong](https://mxgrn.com/blog/function-keys-productivity-trick): a proposal to use the F keys as shortcuts for day to day activities. Which is what they have been designed for, but they have been used for different purposes, and then we introduced another layer of FN keys on top of the existing ones, but the new layer also does not provide great value (apart form Media Controls maybe), so now we need a 3rd party app to use the FN keys for what they were intended to use.
