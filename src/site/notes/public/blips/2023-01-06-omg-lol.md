> [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/), a lovable web domain. Reminds me a bit of beepworld or similar pages in the early 2000s. I am not sure what to do with it yet, but [this is mine](https://philipp.omg.lol/). I am considering moving the blog there, or using their status update on this blog, but for the first variant the latency of the service is too bad, and for the other variant I would have to add JavaScript to this blog, which I'd like to avoid.
