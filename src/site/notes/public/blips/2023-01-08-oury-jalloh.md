> Reminder that yesterday 18 years ago, [Oury Jalloh died in a fire in police custody.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Oury_Jalloh) In a fire the police claimed he created himself. With nothing but a normal lighter on a fireproof mattress. With his feet and arms being tightly bound to said mattress. [Here is a podcast documentation on that matter (🇩🇪)](https://www1.wdr.de/mediathek/audio/wdr5/wdr5-tiefenblick/oury-jalloh/index.html).
