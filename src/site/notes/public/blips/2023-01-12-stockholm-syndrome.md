> [Interesting Twitter thread around the Stockholm Syndrome.](https://twitter.com/erinbowbooks/status/1611171203783294977) In summary, the thread claims that the incident that coined the name Stockholm Syndrome was mostly a situation where incompetent people used this made-up condition to put blame for their incompetence on the victims. It's worth a read, though it skips over the claim [Wikipedia makes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#Stockholm_bank_robbery) that the term was coined after victims refused to testify against their captors in court and started raising money for their defense. And while we're at it, the "Criticism" section of the same article is also well-worth a read.
