> [Threema has some severe issues with their security.](https://breakingthe3ma.app/) In [their response to this,](https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/news-alleged-weaknesses-statement) Threema downplays the findings and generally sounds pretty irritated. Their main argument - that not many people where affected because they coincidentally released a protocol that fixed the things - is not very reassuring.
