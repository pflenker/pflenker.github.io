ChatGPT and the like produce stuff that is plausible, but it might not be true, [as illustrated in this article](https://www.atomic14.com/2023/01/08/prioritising-plausability-over-truthfullness.html). I think the distinction between plausibility and truth is long overdue as this lies at the heart of fake news: Stuff that sounds plausible is taken for being true. Hopefully, AI sparks broad discussions about this topic.
