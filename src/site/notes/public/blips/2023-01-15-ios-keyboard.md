> Here's a [nice write up about how the iPhone keyboard was designed.](https://commoncog.com/case/iphone-keyboard/) It's hard to imagine these days, but typing on touch screens back then was simply impossible. Touch screens were essentially merely more than left-click input devices, multi touch was unsupported, and the touch screens back then were _really_ bad at handling hit zones close to one another.
>
> I am wondering what were the reasons to not explore [T9 like input systems](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)>) more. T9 was well established back then, and you could achieve _insane_ typing speeds with it. I'd guess that this would also hold true on touch screens since the buttons can be much bigger, and there are far less rows/columns to account for than on a `QWERTY` keyboard.
>
> The article mentions a similar approach and its main drawback - the fact that when you pause in the middle of a word, you have to memorize where you left off and are confronted with a word that might be very far off from what you'd intended to type. However, I have the feeling that this limitation alone could have been overcome with software alone.
