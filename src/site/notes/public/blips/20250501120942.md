> Here's a Multi Line Regex for VSCode: `[\s\S\n]+?` ([Source](https://www.waldo.be/2022/01/31/multi-line-text-search-in-vscode-with-regex/)). It comes in handy e.g. when you want to move stuff around in a file, and I use this a lot when refactoring my notes. Let's say you want to use the `title` tag from your front matter as the first heading:
>
> `Example.md`:
>  ```
>---
>someprop: "foo" 
>title: "My Title"
>someotherprop: "bar"
>andanotherprop: "baz"
>--- 
>This is my note, it started out without a H1, it should end up with one. 
>```  
>
> Use the Search function in VSCode, enable regex and enter this in the search field:
> ```
> ---
>([\s\S\n]+?)
>title: "(.*)"
>([\s\S\n]+?)
>---
>```
>
> Then enter this as a replacement:
> ```
>---
>$1
>title: "$2"
>$3
>---
># $2
> ```
>
> This transforms our `Example.md` (and all other files) to this:
>
>```
>---
>someprop: "foo" 
>title: "My Title"
>someotherprop: "bar"
>andanotherprop: "baz"
>---
> # My Title
>This is my note, it started out without a H1, it should end up with one. 
>```
