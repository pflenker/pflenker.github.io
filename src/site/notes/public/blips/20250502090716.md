> My wife and I are re-watching The White Lotus, Season 1 right now. I want to capture here a quote from the resort manager, [Armond](https://www.hbo.com/the-white-lotus/cast-and-crew/armond), who over the course of the season enters a downward spiral, after having been sober for five years. The quote seems like a good opening quote for a potential future blog post about my fear of becoming an addict, so I'm leaving it here:
