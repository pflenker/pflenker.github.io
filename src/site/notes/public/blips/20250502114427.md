> I now moved all my Mastodon posts over to [[public/all-blips\|my Blips page]] and closed my accounts. I wanted to do the same for Bluesky, but then I realized I closed my account already a while ago. Next, I'm going to delete Instagram (and threads, if it's still active), and then all my social media accounts will be gone!
