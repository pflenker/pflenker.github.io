>
> All my old blog posts (before I used Bear Blog) are now migrated. I even restored some that I didn't migrate to Bear back in the day, and I re-added pictures I used for the blog posts back then.  
> Some of the articles are missing images, looks like the Digital Garden plugin I use for publishing has some issues when bulk-uploading hundreds of files. I will fix these manually.
