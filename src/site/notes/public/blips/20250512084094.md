> Quick #braindump of a few things that popped up on my radar. Some of which might make it into blog posts later, but I wanted to persist them here before I forget.
> - I really enjoyed **The White Lotus**, Season 3. I didn't like the intro as much as the respective intros of the previous seasons, but the [extended version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-xTYfAjQEU) is absolutely awesome.
> - In one of the recent episodes of The Pragmatic Engineer, the concept of **"Desirability, Feasibility, Viability"** came up. Cursory Googling results in blog posts which seemingly don't go as deep into that topic as the podcast episode did. Need to re-listen to that part, as it really resonated with me. #ProductManagement
> - The host is called **Gergely**, not Gregory or Gregerly. Reading Skills are so important. #til
> - [This article](https://rikardhjort.medium.com/the-deathbed-fallacy-5e54d9639167), called **The Deathbed Fallacy**, is an interesting read, and it somewhat relates to thoughts I had in the past about over-estimating the abilities of our Future Selves (I related that to coding and the willingness to accumulate technical debt, for example). I need to re-read that article and see how it relates to my mental model. #futureself
> - On a darker note, I stumbled over an example of **Rape Culture** - the idea that there are factors in our culture which normalize male-on-female abuse or rape. I found it in an old song book used by german Scouts. The song is literally about a bishop promising salvation to a girl in exchange for sex. The same songbook also contained at least one similar song. If I find the time, I need to look up that book (I have a copy around here somewhere) and review it.
