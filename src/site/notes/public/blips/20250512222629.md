Another short #braindump : the following quote is stuck in my brain and waits to be persisted here at the very least, or reasoned about and turned into a proper post: _Der Wurm muss den Fisch schmecken, nicht dem Angler_. This translates roughly to: itâ€™s fish who needs to like the worm, not the fisher. Which is a great mantra for #ProductManagement .
