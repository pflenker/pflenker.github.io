Not sure where all this inspiration is coming from recently, but here's another #braindump for potential future blog posts: The history of saving, coming from systems like the C24 where saving was neither the norm nor trivially possible, moving on to systems where saving was expensive in terms of time and memory, and arriving at today, where saving as a concept is fading out. Things that might be worth mentioning: The saving icon, which has lost its meaning with the decline of diskettes, and how changes in the ability to save changed gameplay mechanics (save points, save scumming and so on).
