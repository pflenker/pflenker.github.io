Here's a piece of info that I totally missed, which shows just how out of the loop I am for active web development: The [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API). This works when clicking an internal link (which results in loading the new document from the server). What it does is:

- Store a snapshot from the current state on screen
- Load the page in the background
- Do a smooth transition from the snapshot to the loaded page.

You can even declare which elements are the same across pages and make the browser smoothly animate them into place. I enabled this with the defaults on this page, it's most clearly visible if you navigate in the top nav e.g. from [[public/now\|now]] to [[public/About Me\|About Me]].

That looks really neat!
