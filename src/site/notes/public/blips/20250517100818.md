OMG, the awesome #Murderbot Diaries are now a series! [Hereâ€™s the trailer](https://youtu.be/vEioDeOiqEs?si=hezkuwTI2rSelOsR). I loved the books and will definitely re-read them now. The first episode was pretty good, and to m absolute delight they have actually shot episodes of the in-universe Soap Opera *Sanctuary Moon*. And, almost a given since it runs on Apple TV, the production value is pretty high.
