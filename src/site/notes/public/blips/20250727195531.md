I just watched [Everything Everywhere All At Once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once) and loved it (despite the fact that it's way too long). In stark contrast to Michelle Yeoh's performance there, I *also* watched [Section 31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Section_31), which has to be the worst Star Trek movie of all time. But at least I can still claim that I watched all of Star Trek...
