#adhd #productivity  #SelfOrganization
This article on [Managing ADHD](https://borretti.me/article/notes-on-managing-adhd) has some pretty good advice. Two key learnings for me:
- I have come to many of the conclusions and strategies outlined in there myself. A very important one for me is _writing things down_, even if they are trivial, sometimes even then when writing them down takes the same amount of time as doing the thing. The risk of being side-tracked and forgetting about it is too high otherwise.
- I like the observation that productivity tips usually assume that _executing_ the to dos is not the problem, and therefore focus on organising either your day or your todos (or both) in a way that provides you with room for execution. For some people, like me, it's the execution though which is the bigger challenge.
