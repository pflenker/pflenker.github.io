I recently visited a friend, who introduced me to ice hockey (how awesome is that?) and also provided me with a list of movies I missed for one reason or another: Meg and Meg 2, Moonfall, and: Valerian. How awesome is Valerian, please? Yes the main actor has been mis-casted, yes the story itself is shallow, but my gosh, the visuals! The [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0FX8sd1uVo) alone is an absolute masterpiece.
