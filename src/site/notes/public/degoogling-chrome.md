# Degoogling: Chrome
<p><span>📆 <code>Tuesday, July 23, 2024</code></span></p>
#degoogling

Moving away from Chrome is one of the easier parts of degoogling. Given the [recent developments](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/06/mozilla-is-an-advertising-company-now/), I find Firefox not to be an enticing alternative, so I checked out Safari for the first time in ages.

It has been at least 10 years since I last used Safari regularly, and what stood out back then was the clear lack of... almost everything. These days, though, Safari is actually a quite decent browser. The cross-device sync between Mac, iPad and iPhone works flawlessly, several useful privacy features come out of the box and it has some features I wasn't expecting, such as already displaying the top result with a description while typing in the search query, eliminating the need to first visit the search engine and then select the best result.

Migrating all passwords from Chrome to the iCloud Keychain was trivial, and there are dozens of tutorials out there on how to do that.
