# Enshittification Will Come To AI
<p><span>📆 <code>Wednesday, June 26, 2024</code></span></p>
#ai #llm

Right now, LLMs are hyped everywhere. I, for one, believe that - unlike other hypes like Blockchain, NFT or others - LLMs will _really_ contribute to a significant change in the world. Just by how much isn't clear, and I fully expect this hype to follow the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle).

However, I'd like to point out one thing: Most companies are currently burning money with LLMs. The race is on, and in order to woo as many customers as possible money doesn't matter. But mark my words: Once the dust settles, [enshittification](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) will kick in: Prices will go up, end user convenience will go down. Keep that in mind whenever the next awesome-looking AI feature comes along.
