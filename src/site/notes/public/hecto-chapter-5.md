# Chapter 5: A Text Editor

![flenker-1718270330-0.png|philipp's blog](/img/user/attachments/flenker-1718270330-0.png)


Now that¬†`hecto`¬†can read files, let‚Äôs see if we can teach it to edit files as well. This chapter will be lighter on new concepts, and heavier on assignments to extend `hecto`.

## Assignment 15: Insert ordinary characters
Let‚Äôs first focus on adding ordinary characters into the text. Since we can‚Äôt know if that character will trigger the formation of a new grapheme cluster, we will need to rebuild our internal structure for `Line` upon insertion.

One thing to watch out for here is _movement_: What the user perceives as an insert is actually an insert followed by a step to the right - otherwise we‚Äôd be typing backwards. Another aspect to consider is, of course, graphemes and grapheme clusters. It‚Äôs entirely possible for the inserted character to become part of an existing grapheme cluster - in which case any extra movement would result in moving the caret too far to the right. Or, the newly inserted character could cause the graphemes left and right to merge - think about adding a Handshake Emoji at the right place among Adult Emojis and Zero Width Joiners - they‚Äôd then all form the Adults Holding Hands Emoji, thus actually _removing_ graphemes.

Our strategy to tackle this topic will be to check if the amount of graphemes has changed post-edit: if it grew, we move, otherwise we stay where we are. For anything other than growing after insertion of a new character, we can‚Äôt know how far in any direction we should move. This should cover the cases we aim for with `hecto`.

Here is the assignment:
- Stop crashing on unsupported key presses even in debug mode. We want to silently ignore them.
- Add a new command to handle keypresses of ordinary characters. Find the list of `KeyCode`s emitted by `crossterm` [here.](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/enum.KeyCode.html)
- Add the character to the line by first building up a string based on the TextFragments until the insertion point, then adding the new character, and then appending the remaining graphemes from the remaining TextFragments. Then, rebuild the internal data structure for `Line`.
- Handle the case where insertion is attempted below the last line of the document by creating a new `Line` and appending it to your `Buffer`.
- You need to move after inserting a character, as indicated above.
- Hint: Get a mutable reference to a vector member by using  `get_mut` instead of `get`.

**Code Review:** [Here is my code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/33190fcbf820dd880025531755aa60de72b9d8cb)

## Assignment 16: Simple Deletion
Now we want `Delete` and `Backspace` to work. `Backspace` is essentially a ‚Äúmove left, then delete‚Äù. `Delete` will work pretty similar to insert above, with the difference that we have to worry even less about grapheme widths - deleting one cluster should in the vast majority of cases decrease the amount of graphemes by 1. We‚Äôll handle deletion around the edges of a row later.

Here is the assignment:
- On `Delete` before the end of a row, remove the grapheme cluster to the right of the caret.
- On `Backspace` after the start of a row, go one step to the left and then remove the grapheme cluster to the right of the caret.
- Ignore deleting at the start/end of a row for this assignment.

**Code Review:** [Here is how I did it.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/35abb1e905ebc0956583fc76e27a2c8ad9c22d6d)

## Assignment 17: Complex Deletion
We now want some edge cases to work:
- Backspace at the top-left of the document should do nothing
- Delete at the bottom-right of the document should do nothing
- Backspace at the start of the line should append the current line to the previous one
- Delete at the end of the line should append the next line to the current one.

To achieve this, we will need to create a way to append one line to another. Since we want to re-calculate the grapheme clusters, converting both lines to a string, merging them and re-creating the internal `Ver<TextFragment>` sounds like a good idea. Removing an entry from a `Vec` can be done by calling `remove` on it, which also returns the element which was removed.

Here is the assignment:
- Implement complex deletion as outlined above.

## Assignment 17: Code Review
[Here is how I solved it.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/1c4d362533494bf02c3a18f9a98eaf042b18f4a1)

Aside from the fact that I am now starting to fix the bugs I am introducing (Unit Tests, anyone?), my code contained two interesting aspects. One revolves around Rust‚Äôs Borrow Checker, and one around side effects from traits. Let‚Äôs start with the first one.

## Rust‚Äôs Borrow Checker in Action
We‚Äôve met Rust‚Äôs approach to type safety already in earlier chapters. When it comes to modifying data, Rust imposes strict rules, particularly with how mutable and immutable references are handled.

Consider this function from my commit:
```rust
  pub fn delete(&mut self, at: Location) {
        if let Some(line) = self.lines.get(at.line_index) {
            if at.grapheme_index >= line.grapheme_count()
                && self.lines.len() > at.line_index.saturating_add(1)
            {
                let next_line = self.lines.remove(at.line_index.saturating_add(1));
                self.lines[at.line_index].append(&next_line);
            } else if at.grapheme_index < line.grapheme_count() {
                self.lines[at.line_index].delete(at.grapheme_index);
            }
        }
    }
```

The function accesses the current line twice: Once in the surrounding `if let Some(line)`, and subsequently when calling `append` or  `delete`. It‚Äôs impossible to refactor this code to use `get_mut` for the surrounding `if let` and get rid of that extra access. Why?

### Memory Safety and Mutable References
Rust ensures memory safety by enforcing exclusive access to mutable data. The `&mut self` in the function signature means that while delete is executing, no other part of our program can modify the self struct (`Line` in this case). This is the same as borrowing a physical object: while it‚Äôs in your possession, nobody else can use it.
Excluding the initial `if let`, notice that self.lines (and thus self) is not altered while any reference to an element within `self.lines` is active. Removing `next_line` is a distinct operation that modifies `self`, followed by the call to `append`.

### Why there isn‚Äôt a Borrow Checker Error
The question then is: Why doesn‚Äôt the reference `line`, derived from `if let Some(line)`, trigger a borrow checker error? The answer lies in the timing and scope of its use. It‚Äôs only used once, before any mutating operation takes place. Afterwards, this reference becomes invalid. Adding any operation on line after the mutable operations begin, even a simple read, would invalidate the code and result in a compiler error.

## Traits and Automatic Implementation
Let‚Äôs also discuss another code snippet from my commit:
```rust
impl fmt::Display for Line {
    fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        let result: String = self
            .fragments
            .iter()
            .map(|fragment| fragment.grapheme.clone())
            .collect();
        write!(formatter, "{result}")
    }
}
```

The goal at this stage was to implement a `to_string` function which turns `Line` into a `String`,  to be used for appending one `Line` to another. So why did I implement `Display` here?

Before I explain, I want to stress that not doing it like I did is a perfectly valid approach. I took this route to highlight some more interesting things about Rust - just implementing a simple `to_string` is fine.

What I implemented here is the `Display` trait. You might recall from previous chapters that this trait allows data structures to be printed out to the user, for instance with `println!(‚Äú{my_struct}‚Äù);`. Converting something into a string is such a common operation that a trait for this exists: [ToString](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html).  There‚Äôs also a counterpart trait, which we also _could_ have implemented: [FromStr](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html). As you already know by now, implementing traits gives you benefits in certain contexts. But what I wanted to point out here, and why I implemented `Display`, and not `ToString`, is that implementing some traits hands you an automatic implementation of another trait. We saw this in passing when we implemented the `From` trait and got the implementation of `into` for free - and in this case, we‚Äôre implementing `Display`, resulting in an automatic implementation of the `ToString` trait, which provides `to_string`. `Display` is generally considered more versatile than implementing `ToString`.

The underlying concept is called a [_blanket implementation_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html): You can write a blanket implementation of Trait A for any type that implements Trait B, effectively making Trait B implementing Trait A as well.

## Assignment 18: Tab and Enter
We still need to support two additional keys: `Tab`, which should simply insert a `\t`, and `Enter`.

To handle `Enter`, we need to extend `Line` in a way that allows us to split the line at the current location - shortening the current line, and returning a new `Line` with the remainder. Besides using `push()` to add an entry at the end of a `Vec`, we can use `insert(index: usize)` to add an item at the desired location. All following entries will be shifted to the right. A `Vec` also allows splitting by calling `split_off`.

Here‚Äôs a quick Rust Playground to illustrate this:
```rust
pub fn main() {
    let mut first_vec = vec!["Entry #1".to_string(),"Entry #2".to_string()];
    println!("{first_vec:#?}");
    
    for num in 4..=10 {
        first_vec.push(format!("Entry #{num}"));

    }
    println!("{first_vec:#?}");
    // Oops, missed something!
    first_vec.insert(2, "Entry #3".to_string());
    println!("{first_vec:#?}");
    
    let second_vec = first_vec.split_off(5);
    println!("{first_vec:#?}");
    println!("{second_vec:#?}");
    
}
```
[Link to Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=cd691d447d32866b1375aa357eec8b3e)

Here‚Äôs the assignment:
- Handle  `Tab` by treating tab as an insertion of `\t`.
- Handle `Enter`:
  - If `Enter` is pressed within a `Line`, split the line and create a new line from the remainder.
  - If `Enter` is pressed at the beginning of a line, place a new, empty `Line` before the current one.
  - Similarly, if `Enter` is pressed at the end of a line, place a new, empty line after the current one.
  - If `Enter` is pressed outside of a valid line (e.g. at the bottom of the document, where we allow navigating to), add a new, empty `Line` to the end of the document.
  - Make sure you move the caret accordingly and that you scroll if needed.

**Code Review:** [Here‚Äôs my code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/bfa91016ebe9860d636634d5a677aee2f1c55137)

## Data Structures in Text Editors
We've now established our data structure for `hecto`. Stripping away the outer structs reveals that we store metadata for each visible grapheme within a `vec`. These `vecs`, which each represent a line, are then grouped within another `vec`. This arrangement is fairly typical for text editors handling formatted text. For instance, [SlateJS](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext), a JavaScript-based rich text editor, employs nodes to capture the formatting attributes applied to text segments, as shown below:

```json
[
      {
        "text": "Hello,",
        "bold": true
      },
      {
        "text": " World",
        "bold": true,
        "underline": true
      },
      {
        "text": "!",
        "underline": true
      }
]
```

As you might imagine, finding and defining suitable data structures for text editors is a well-understood problem now, which includes reasoning about performance, types of insertions (i.e. do inserts typically happen around the same area, or randomly distributed across the text?) and other considerations. A common data structure for texts is a [Rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29). Ropes break texts into smaller, manageable pieces and organises them into a binary tree structure.

The beauty of a Rope lies in its efficiency‚Äîespecially when you need to insert or delete text. With a Rope, these operations don't require shifting large blocks of text around, which keeps things running smoothly even as documents get longer. Navigating through text is also more efficient with a Rope, as each node in the tree keeps track of the text length below it, making it quick to jump to different parts of the document.

For this tutorial, we‚Äôre going to stick with our inefficient internal data structure, but if you‚Äôre interested to learn how to use a rope in Rust, take a look at  [Ropey](https://docs.rs/ropey/latest/ropey/#).

## Assignment 19: Saving to Disk
Editing is useless without saving, so let‚Äôs implement saving to disk for an existing file. We will implement ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù later.

To do so, we need to track the file name in the `Buffer`. Once the user presses `Ctrl-S`, we are going to save our file to disk.

Here is a small sample which writes a string to disk:
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;

fn main() {
    let mut file = File::create("example.txt").expect("Could not create file");
    writeln!(file, "Hello, World!")
        .expect("Could not write to file");
}
```
[Link to Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=7fa170a3d5c5ca98b408c9d6de61f6f1)

Similar to `println!`, `writeln!` ensures that the line is written and a newline is added to the end.

Here‚Äôs the assignment:
- Keep track of the file name when loading a file from disk.
- When editing an existing file, implement the command `Ctrl+S` to save the file to disk.
- For now, you can suppress any errors which might happen during saving, we will handle them properly later in this chapter.

## Assignment 19: Code Review
[Here is my code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/459b8264067e67bdeecd88d9e6a37925e45d0f39)

We‚Äôve discussed line breaks earlier in this tutorial, but there are some more interesting aspects to learn. We‚Äôve already seen that there are multiple types of white spaces beyond a normal ‚ÄúSpace‚Äô - Tabs, Zero-Width-Joiners and more - so it‚Äôs unsurprising that there are also multiple types of line breaks. To name a few, there are Line Separators, Paragraph Separators, a Vertical Tab, and even Form Feed, which was used to direct the printer to eject the current paper and continue printing on top of another.

A second aspect to be aware of is that, to this day, operating systems have different views about what a new line actually _is_. Windows treats `\r\n` as a line break, whereas on Linux and Mac, a `\n` is sufficient. This is commonly referred to as ‚ÄúCRLF‚Äù (Carriage Return, Line Feed) for the Windows case, and as ‚ÄúLF‚Äù (Line Feed) for the Linux/Mac case. We‚Äôre slowly transitioning towards a state where this distinction does not matter, but opening a text file written on a Mac with an old text editor on Windows would lead to display issues, and executing a shell script on a Linux system written on Windows might also lead to issues.

`hecto` is elegantly side-stepping this issue, because of three reasons:
- The way we read in files handles newlines properly for us
- We do not directly work with newlines during text editing
- The way we save files, with `writeln!`, also handles newlines properly for us.

## User Interface
Our Text Viewer currently has no way of showing any information, besides the text itself, to the user. As a consequence:
- We can‚Äôt inform the user if a file-open or save was unsuccessful
- We can‚Äôt inform the user if a save was successful
- The user has to guess how to save a file
- Wen can‚Äôt offer the user a way to save their new files, because there is no way to display any input prompt with which the user could add their own file name.

That won‚Äôt do, so we‚Äôre going to build up some user interface which will display useful information to the user, before we adapt it to also handle prompts.  More specifically, we‚Äôre going to add two lines to the bottom of the editor: A _status bar_, which will hold information about the document, and a _message bar_, which will show notifications to the user. Later, we will use the message bar also to allow user input.

## Assignment 20: Simple Status Bar
Let‚Äôs start very basic:
- Adjust `hecto` to leave room for 2 additional rows at the bottom.
- Add a status bar as the first of the two rows. It should contain:
  - The file name if present
  - The number of lines in the current file
  - A line indicator to indicate in which line the caret is currently placed
  - An indicator which shows if the file has been modified or not.
There is no need to care about formatting, alignment or handling any kind of string lengths at this point. We are going to make this pretty in the next step.

To implement this, you‚Äôd need to implement a new `struct`, which, similar to `View`, renders itself at the right part of the screen and refreshes itself every time it‚Äôs necessary. Then you‚Äôd need to expose the information you want to display from `View` to `Editor`, and pass it then to the new struct, so that it‚Äôs available on the next refresh.

**Code Review:** [Here‚Äôs my code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/edb05e49078b7427125c47a757a2ee6cd8fde844)

## Assignment 21: Fancy Status Bar
Let‚Äôs make the status bar fancy.  We want to:
- Arrange the data on the status bar
- Properly handle weirdly-sized terminals
- Make the line stand out visually.

Let‚Äôs start with the arrangement of the data. This is what we want to display:
```
hecto.rs - 23 lines (modified)                                      2/23
```
- We start with the file name (without the path), or `[No Name]` if none is given.
- We then display the number of lines in that file.
- If a document is modified, we show `(modified)`
- To the far right, we show the current line and the total amount of lines (in the example above: Line 2 of a total of 23 lines).

To make alignment easier, here‚Äôs a Rust Playground which shows you how to use string formatting for alignment:
```rust

fn main() {
    let left = "Left";
    let middle = "Middle";
    let right = "Right";
    
    println!("String Alignment with spaces:");
    println!("{:<15}{:^15}{:>15}", left,middle, right);  
    println!();
    
    println!("Right align with dots:");
    println!("{:.>10}", "dots"); 
    println!();
    
    println!("Alignment in detail with different characters:");
    println!("{:.<15}{:-^15}{:#>15}", left,middle, right);  
    println!();
    
    
    println!("Alignment where width < length:");
    println!("{:<3}{:^3}{:>3}", left,middle, right);
    println!();
     
    
    println!("Truncation:");
    println!("{:.5}", "Truncated");
    println!();
    
    println!("Truncation & Alignment:");
    println!("{:<15.3}{:^15.3}{:>15.3}", left, middle, right); 
}
```
[Link to Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=0ae5054a448ff4a1ad0d1995fc89b026) / [Link to the Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/)

Let‚Äôs now define how `hecto` behaves on weirdly sized terminals:
- If the Terminal is less than 3 rows high, only the status bar and message bar are visible.
- If it is only 1 row high, only the message bar is visible.
- We assume that our terminal will be always at least 100 columns wide. For any terminal narrower than that, we are going to truncate or hide the information on the status bar.
- On a typical file,  we expect the file name to be no longer than 50 characters.
- Since we have 50 more columns available, and the hard coded strings (including whitespaces) take up 22 columns, the line indicators can take up to 28 columns. So we will start having display issues if a file with a title that is 50 characters long and which contains  more than a hundred million lines is open, and the current line is below the one hundredth million line. It‚Äôs fine to not optimise for that edge case.

Lastly, let‚Äôs investigate how we can make the row stand out visually. [Crossterm lists a couple of attributes we can use](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/style/enum.Attribute.html) , alongside a helpful list of cross-platform support. What we‚Äôre going to do is to ~~make the Status Bar blink rapidly~~ invert the foreground and background color for the status bar. To do so, we have to:
- Write out `Attribute::Reverse` prior to printing the line
- Print out the entire line until the edge of the screen
- Write out `Attribute::Reset ` to ensure that follow up write operations to the terminal are not printed out reversed.
`crossterm` prints out the correct escape codes for us - the command is called ‚ÄúSelect Graphic Rendition‚Äù (SGR). [Wikipedia has the full list of parameters.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_%28Select_Graphic_Rendition%29_parameters)

Here‚Äôs the assignment now:
- Improve displaying of the status bar as outlined above.
- While we‚Äôre testing rendering, let‚Äôs also disable line wrap when starting hecto, and enable it upon exit,  by using [DisableLineWrap](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/terminal/struct.DisableLineWrap.html) and `EnableLineWrap`. This will remove artefacts from resizing (since we‚Äôre not drawing to the last line), and safeguard us against writing too long lines.
- Let‚Äôs also set the terminal title to the file name. To do this, we can use [SetTitle](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/terminal/struct.SetTitle.html). We don‚Äôt have to restore the old title upon leaving, the terminal will do this for us.

## Assignment 21: Code Review
[Here‚Äôs the code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/a3335e9c08dd7bd08585d838ddc7a864dab12673)

There is one code snippet I‚Äôd like to discuss. Here it is:

```rust
    let mut position_y = 0;
    let mut is_visible = false;
    if let Some(result) = size
            .height
            .checked_sub(self.margin_bottom)
            .and_then(|result| result.checked_sub(1))
    {
            position_y = result;
            is_visible = true;
    }
        self.position_y = position_y;
        self.is_visible = is_visible;
```

Let‚Äôs pick this apart. We have seen `and_then` previously - it simply allows us chaining two operations. Essentially, we‚Äôre performing `checked_sub` twice. But what does it do?

This logic comes from the `StatusBar` and determines whether or not it should be rendered, and where. In `View`, we do this differently: we determine the height with `saturating_sub`, and if the view has a height of 0, it‚Äôs not displayed. `StatusBar`, however, has no height (or an implicit height of 1, but no internal field called height), so this logic can‚Äôt be used here. So what we do instead is that we subtract the margin and 1 from the terminal size. If the result would go below 0, `StatusBar` can be considered as invisible, as the starting point for the status bar would be outside of the visible bounds.

That‚Äôs what `checked_sub` does: It attempts to perform the subtraction. If successful, it returns the result. If not, in case of an underflow, it returns None.

## Assignment 22: A Simple Message Bar
Now that our Status Bar is in place, let‚Äôs fill that final row with a Message Bar.  This Message Bar will do a couple of things:
- Show a default text/help when opening `hecto`
- Show messages, like error messages, or other notifications
- Serve as an input area for prompts, such as prompting for the file name to save to.

We start, as usual, simple:
- Implement a Message Bar which reads `HELP: Ctrl-S = save | Ctrl-Q = quit`
- Since we have now 3 UI components, we are faced with quite some code duplication. Refactor your code to reduce code duplication as much as possible.

**Code Review:**  [Here is my code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/f89c5bc2251df3a154a63df9c6f37ac7b5068e6e)

## Assignment 23: Expiring Messages
We now want messages to disappear after at most 5 seconds. To achieve this, we will track the time at which a message has been rendered for the first time, and upon each re-render, we check if 5 seconds or more have passed. If so, we are going to hide the message.

To do so, we are going to use [Durations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Duration.html#method.new) and [Instants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html). Let‚Äôs meet them in this Rust Playground:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use std::time::Instant;
use std::thread;


fn main() {

    let before_sleep = Instant::now();
    let five_seconds = Duration::new(5, 0);
    let seven_seconds = Duration::new(7, 0);
    let ten_seconds = Duration::new(10, 0);

    println!("Going to sleep now for seven seconds!");
    thread::sleep(seven_seconds); // Sleep for more than 5, but less than 10 seconds
    let after_sleep = Instant::now();
    
    if after_sleep - before_sleep > five_seconds {
        println!("Five seconds have passed!");
    }

    if after_sleep - before_sleep > ten_seconds {

As a side note: Rust guarantees to sleep for _at least_ the specified duration, but it can‚Äôt guarantee to sleep _exactly_ for the given duration.

## Assignment 24: Better Communication to the User

Let‚Äôs make better use of our Message Bar. We want to use our message bar to communicate a couple of errors we previously ignored to the user. For this, we need to propagate the error upward to the Editor, and then display it to the user. We also want to send a message in some non-error cases, for example when we save the file successfully to disk.

The challenge here, at least if your code looks similar to mine, is the following: At this point, we‚Äôre converting any `crossterm` event into an `EditorCommand`, and pass it down to `View`, which acts on it e.g. by saving.  In order to properly react to an error, we could adapt `handle_command` to receive a `Result` and use `MessageBar` to display the error. But how do we know if the file has been saved successfully? Well, we could, for instance, check if the command we‚Äôve just forwarded to `View` was a `Save` and if everything worked correctly print out the success message. That‚Äôs perfectly doable.

However, we‚Äôre already observing that what we‚Äôre getting from `crossterm` and passing on to `Editor` can be divided into editing commands - `Delete`, `Insert(char)` and so on - and other commands such as `Quit`, `Save`  or `Resize`, which require a different behaviour. With that in mind, it makes sense to revisit `EditorCommand` and separate the different types of commands from one another.

With that in mind, here‚Äôs the assignment:
- If saving fails, display the message `Error writing file!`
- If opening a file fails, display the message `ERR: Could not open file: ` followed by the file name.
- After successful saving, display the message `File saved successfully.`
- If the user tries to quit if a file is modified, display the following message: `WARNING! File has unsaved changes. Press Ctrl-Q {} more times to quit.` , where `{}` starts at 3 and counts down to 0. So in total, the user has to press CTRL-Q 3 times in order to quit with an unsaved file, discarding the changes.
- Bonus Assignment:
  - Separate your EditorCommands into different command types and adjust your code appropriately.

## Assignment 25: Save as‚Ä¶
Currently, when the user runs `hecto` without any arguments, they get a blank file to edit but have no way of saving. Let‚Äôs work on introducing a prompt at the bottom, in place of the message bar, which allows the user to enter a file name.

We aim for simplicity here, so we are not going to build any asynchronous messaging or observer patterns or something similar. Instead, our `Editor` struct stays responsible for querying for status and updating itself, and other components, if needed.

Here is the assignment:
- Create a new UI Component called CommandBar.
- It should replace the Message Bar on press of `ctrl+s` if the currently open file has no file name.
- It should display the string: `Save As: `  
- It should allow entering data, similar to how `View` allows entering data.
- It should truncate the displayed file name on the left in case of  long paths/filenames to enter.
- It should expose the current caret position on screen to `Editor`, similar to how `View` does it.
- It should expose the string entered to `Editor`.
- Hitting `Esc` should dismiss the prompt without saving. We should display `Save aborted.`
- Hitting `Enter` if data was entered attempts to save the current file to the given file name.
- Dismissing the Command Bar should show the message bar again.

Code Review: Discuss as_ref, Path and PathBuf

## Assignment 25: Code Review
[Here is my code.](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial/commit/28658f8d43a9d51ff088502235dff1438919f5cb)

Before we end this chapter, let‚Äôs take a closer look at a code change I made, because it helps us understand some design concepts and Rust concepts a bit better.
It‚Äôs about my `FileInfo` struct.

Here‚Äôs the updated code, with the relevant changes mentioned in the comments:
```rust
#[derive(Default, Debug)]
pub struct FileInfo {
    path: Option<PathBuf>, // No longer pub
}

impl FileInfo {
    pub fn from(file_name: &str) -> Self {
        Self {
            path: Some(PathBuf::from(file_name)),
        }
    }
	// New fn:
    pub fn get_path(&self) -> Option<&Path> {
        self.path.as_deref()
    }

	//New fn:
    pub const fn has_path(&self) -> bool {
        self.path.is_some()
    }
}
```

First of all, let‚Äôs discuss the motivation behind the code change.

Before we introduced a `save_as` functionality, there was ever only one `FileInfo` available, which was effectively immutable: Once set, the `FileInfo` never changed, and it either had a `PathBuf` (on loading a file) or it didn‚Äôt.

With the introduction of `save_as`, I had to decide: Is `FileInfo` something that is mutable - implying that a call to `save_as` would need `FileInfo` to update its `path` - or is it immutable - implying that one `FileInfo` needs to be replaced with another on file save?

I decided for the latter. I think it‚Äôs not terribly important for `hecto` right now to get this decision 100% right, but the code change above reflects my desire to keep `FileInfo` immutable: Instead of allowing direct access to `path`, I created a getter function, and I also exposed `has_path` as a convenience function.

This explains the _why_, but not the _how_ - the code change above does two surprising things:
- It returns an `Option<&Path>` instead of an `Option<&PathBuf>`
- It calls `as_deref` on `self.path` to do so.
Why?

First, `Path` and `PathBuf` are very similar to `String` and `str` , which is why I used both in the code above. This allows transforming the code into something we know better - and which will make it easier for us to understand the `as_deref`. We do so by changing `path` in the struct as follows:
```rust
pub struct FileInfo {
    path: Option<String>,
}
```
 
Our first attempt to return `path` might look like this:
```rust 
    pub fn get_path(&self) -> Option<String> {
        self.path
    }
```

This doesn‚Äôt work, and if you remember the Move Semantics we discussed earlier it becomes clear why: If we move `String` out, we can‚Äôt keep it ourselves - the existing `Option` would be invalidated. `String` does not implement the `copy` trait, so a copy of the path won‚Äôt be returned automatically.

That‚Äôs fine, we don‚Äôt need to copy or clone it anyway, since we do not plan to modify it. So how about this?

```rust 
    pub fn get_path(&self) -> Option<&String> {
        self.path.as_ref()
    }
```

This works! `as_ref` turns the item within the option into a reference to that item, which is what we want. Working with `&String` instead of `String` can be tricky, but this is generally an approach that works. But what if we want to return a `&str` instead, given that there is no need for the overhead in `String`, it‚Äôs supposed to be readonly anyways. This leads us to:

```rust
    pub fn get_path(&self) -> Option<&str> {
        self.path.as_deref()
    }
```

`as_deref` does the opposite of `as_ref` above, and if you remember that dereferencing a `String` yields a `&str`, it‚Äôs easy to understand that now an `Option<&str>`, as desired.

## Wrap Up & Outlook
In this chapter, `hecto` has gained a lot of functionality: Not only did we implement the ability to edit files, we also implemented a responsive User Interface and allowed the user to save their changes. We learned about data structures for Text Editors, and deepened our understanding of Rust‚Äôs ownership system in the process.

In the [[public/hecto-chapter-6\|next chapter]], we‚Äôre going to allow users to search.
