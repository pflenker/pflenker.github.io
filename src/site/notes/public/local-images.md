Around 2012 was the golden era of iOS apps. Smart phones where still quite new, and people were much more willing to scout the app stores for interesting and fun apps, or they were at least consuming blogs doing the same for them.  Essentially, "build it and they will come" worked at that time.

Local Images was my first attempt to play around with the wider Apple ecosystem: In-App Purchases, Ads, Apps targeted for both iPhones and iPads. I was _incredibly_ bored at work and dreamed of a life as a successful indie developer.

The app accessed the user's location and downloaded images from nearby, with a few tweaks to filter out everyday images and highlight beautiful panorama-like pics. The app showed an ad, which you could get rid of for the lowest tier of Apple's in-app purchases.

That's all the app did, nothing fancy. I didn't intend do get rich with it, I just wanted to get a feel of the basics of app development. So I got what I came for and left with a solid understanding of the
then-current Apple ecosystem.

And what I also learned is that if the one feature your app has is displaying beautiful stuff, don't put an ad there. That's just mean.
