# Migrating to the next chapter of blogging
<p><span>📆 <code>Tuesday, March 26, 2024</code></span></p>

I‘m moving [flenker.blog](https://flenker.blog) from a Jekyll-based solution hosted on GitHub to [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev). I enjoy Jekyll a lot, but the steps to go through to publish the simplest of posts are just too many - especially on the go (I’m typing this post on my iPhone). bearblog.dev fills these needs for reduced friction while maintaining the one feature I enjoyed most on github: incredibly fast load times.

I’m going to migrate my old posts over in the upcoming days before I go and hit the switch to archive the old blog and using this one going forward.
