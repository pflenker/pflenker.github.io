# Family Life
Well, I turned 40!

For years now I have been hosting princess birthdays, balloon birthdays, unicorn birthdays... which is why I wished for a space-themed birthday party for myself. And what can I say, my family surprised me with a rocket shaped pinata, astronauts, a Star Trek themed treasure hunt and more. It was absolutely fantastic.

We also had a very relaxing vacation in Denmark, though I have to say that I didn't see a lot of Danes there, it was mostly Germans. Which made me question the full-day drive we had to go through in order to go there.

# Back to Paper
After a couple of weeks vibe-coding with Obsidian, I am satistifed with my learnings and have now archived my code. At the same time, I feel that all these notifications that come with "modern tech" play a big role in a feeling of perpetual stress. It's not uncommon for me to open my mails to look up a specific piece of information, and an hour later I come out of a rabbit hole with tons of things being done - but without that piece of info.

So I am now experimenting with good old Pen and Paper again. Not with Bullet Journal, which I did in the past, but with the plain old Getting Things Done. Let's see how this works out.
