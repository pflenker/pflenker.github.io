# Halloween
Halloween is done, and we were having a blast. This year, we have set up a graveyard, complete with fog and creepy music. Some guy told me that I won this year but he would win next year. I told him that I am not a fan of this kind of childish comparisons, and he is welcome to check next year that he stands no chance anyways.

# School Stuff
Our eldest daughter will move to a new school next year, which means that this year there will be a lot of evaluating, getting a recommendation about which school to choose, visiting said schools and so on. Given that's the first time for us, we're all very excited.

Also, I was elected to be the representative of all parents for the current school of both girls. This happened more or less by accident - I wanted to be elected to be part of the school conference, but apparently I was too enthusiastic and people took it as a signal that I wanted to be the parent representative. Oh well. But still, it's fun.

# Cyber Week
Zalando is approaching Cyber Week, and with this comes more work than usual, more diligence, and more tiny bits and pieces to account for. The expected result, though, is a boring and calm Black Friday.
