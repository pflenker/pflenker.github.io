# Autumn Vacation
My family and I spent a very relaxing week in the Netherlands, which is overall a very family friendly country. Now there's a stretch of a couple of weeks ahead of us, and then suddenly it'll be Christmas again!

Besides that, there's nothing on our plates apart from the same old. Which is to be expected, because at this time of the (school) year all kinds of tiny, but still tedious things tend to take place, such as our daughter's very first school trip.
