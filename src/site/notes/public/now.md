# family life
we just had a relaxing holiday in the nearby mountains - or what you would call mountains if you have never seen a mountain, as my kids. here in the area are barely even any hills. they were having a blast, and we returned refreshed and relaxed. at the same time, my spouse is really kicking her self organization skills up a notch, which is dragging me with her and making us overall more effective. awesome! next up are two birthday parties, and then we will be looking forward to enjoying the upcoming summer.

# growing as a lead & mentor
my team in zalando is currently splitting up and soon i will be leading two teams (again). looking forward to it, but there's a lot of friction ahead until all is set up.

# this and that
i recently improved my note skills using obsidian, and have migrated my self organisation framework from gtd to something bullet journal inspired. it works pretty well, looking forward how it plays out.

also i am looking at pulling in this page as well as my blog into obsidian and publish from there - right now i have - depending on how you count - at least two, possibly more, interfaces i need to go through in order to publish anything. so it might be that this very page here changes soon.
