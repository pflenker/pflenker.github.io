# Cultivating Friendships
I recently had a very silly epiphany.

I was feeling a bit depressed, especially because I don't have many friends here in the area. Back when I was at university, I was frequently going out to watch a movie, or to simply hang out with my friends, but we've all since moved to different cities, and I don't have similar friends these days. So there I was, all sulky, when the epiphany hit: Instead of complaning about the lack of new friendships, I should actually cultivate my existing ones. 

Told you it was silly. But the thing is, I have this tendency to first look forward to hang out with my friends, but the nearer it draws, the more I dread the travel time, sleeping somewhere else and so on, and then, more often than I'd like to admit, I'd cancel my visit. Or I don't plan on visiting in the first place.

I am now turning this around. I was organising a meeting of my old school friends to celebrate our 20 year anniversary, I was visiting a good friend in Switzerland and I am planning to visit another friend next month. Yes, it's exhausting, but it's also refreshing and recharging my (social) batteries, and instead of avoiding the exhaustion, I try to ensure I have plenty of free time planned around these social events to recover e.g. from the travel. So that's what is currently on the agenda for me.

# Social Commitment
I accidentally got elected to be the spokesperson for all parents at my kid's school. The thing is, I really wanted to be elected to join the conference, but my pitch was a bit overenthusiastic so I got nominated for that other thing instead. Which also entails joining the school conference, so there's that.

Anyways, I am quite happy about that even though I am not sure how I will be able to find all that time. The thing is, and this may sound condescending: Usually, the people who are doing this kind of work are people with a lot of time at their hands. A LOT of time. And they tend to overthink things. Also, I have that uneasy feeling for some years now that the people who are usually representing the parents at school are not always having the kids at the front and center of their minds. For example, the toilets at school are in bad shape, same as everywhere in Germany, and the reason is the same as everywhere else: Not enough toilets for all the kids. In response to that, the idea was to send around an email which was written with (I am sure) best intentions at heart, it was very well written, but it was effectively shaming the kids for not being able to use the toilet properly. At the same time, the amount of pupils at school has risen 10% over the past 3 years, while the amount of toilets has remained constant. That doesn't fit together. 

So I hope I can make a difference, and while I know that people belittle this kind of social commitment, I love it as it can make a real, tangible difference. You know, for the children.

# Ice Hockey
For the first time of my life I have watched an ice hockey game and I am surprised to discover that I enjoyed it. The ZSC (Zurich) won against Bern, and I was told to cheer for the ZSC, so I was happy with the result.
