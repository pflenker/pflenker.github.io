# Time to Celebrate!
In the past few days and weeks, there have been a couple of things to celebrate.

Sophia, our youngest, had her birthday, and she wished for a birthday party with the theme: Balloons.

That one was fun and easy to do: I got some helium and filled around 100 balloons with it, which were floating around everywhere in the house. We also hired a balloon artists - who started out as a balloon clown [^1] - who made all kinds of balloon animals and shapes for the guests. We also did a balloon-themed scavenger hunt. The story was that the mean pirate balloons had dog-napped Sophia's favourite toy -  her plush dog woof-woof - and the guests needed to pursue them before they float away with their victim. Everyone had a blast.

The second celebration was that one of my oldest friends got married. To celebrate the occasion, a few other friends and me hired a freelance artist on Etsy to draw us - Star Trek style:

A surprisingly huge amount of time went into getting the ranks and the uniform colours right:
- The couple should have the same rank
- No one should outrank the couple
- Given that she works in administration and he is a police officer, the uniforms should reflect that
- For the other people in the image, the uniforms should also approximate their respective jobs.

# Work Life
It's Evaluation time, which is the time of the year which traditionally takes a lot of my attention. Since this is one of the single most meaningful moments for each person in my teams, I invest a lot of time in providing them with meaningful feedback. But it's also exhausting, if not for anything else, then because it simply takes time.

# Technical Stuff
I closed my Instagram account, all my Mastodon accounts, and I merged my blog from bearblog.dev and my profile and now page from omg.lol into one: the very page you're looking at right now.
It was a lot of fun, and it's now in a state which looks as if it could be sustainable. I tracked some of the specifics about my setup [[public/Note-0250605122815\|here]]. If I find the time I will expand this into a couple of blog posts.

One of the benefits of the new setup that you can already see is that it's now way easier for me to add images to my now page, something which really adds depth, from my point of view.

# Running
I'm currently preparing for a half marathon, the [Maxilauf in Hamm](https://maxilauf.de/). Preparation is a lot of fun, and I'm breaking some of my own records while preparing for it. I also have set up some sort of hub for my Running hobby: [[public/Running\|Running]], which I intend to keep up to date every now and then.
