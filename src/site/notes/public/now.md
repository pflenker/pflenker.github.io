Birthday Season is over now. After the Baloon-themed party for my younger kid, we transformed our house into Hogwarts for the party of the elder kid. It was a blast for everyone involved, but I am very happy that the next round of birthdays is now very far away.

We also went to a musical the other day and enjoyed a "young audience" version of Shrek. That was fun! I love the first two Shrek films, after they have basically murdered the franchise with all these sequels and spin-offs, and the musical is pretty close to the original source material. The kids liked it, too.

# Work Life
I think I'm currently going through a bit of a motivation slump, which is not unusual for me at this time of the year. I'm really looking forward to the summer vacations.

# Programming
I'm in the middle of building up my first-ever obsidian plugin, a blend of org-mode and outliner functionality. I'm dog-feeding myself and use the plugin every day, and even though it's still far away from anything resembling a beta, it's already super helpful.
