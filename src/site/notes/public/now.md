# Family Life
Summer is officially over. Not only is it now fall, the school has also started again, vacations are behind us and so on. We're all now finding our own paces again. The kids are happy to be back at school, which is the most important thing, because if they are unhappy, everything else gets way more difficult.

# Back to Paper
You know what the advantage of paper is? It doesn't tell you that you have 6 new emails while you write on it. I started a journey back to paper around a month ago, and so far it has been very liberating, and I have the feeling that a) I get a lot more meaningful stuff done, and b) less things slip through the cracks.  I'll keep an eye on how things are working out.

# Getting fit - again
We all came back from vacation weighing a bit more than before. Which now means to get fit again. I planned to participate in some official runs during fall, but some of them are on dates where I am not available, others didn't sound enticing - long story short, I am "only" signed up to 2 runs in the near future. That's good enough for me though.
