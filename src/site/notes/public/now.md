# Family Life
It's the last week of school. For the younger one, it's the last week of her first year in school ever, and both kids are ready for summer vacation. So are my wife and I, to be honest, though we are a bit intimidated by a daunting long drive to Denmark (as opposed to a 3 hour drive to Borkum in the past years). 

And another birthday is coming up: Mine own, I turn 40 in August and I am going to have a small party. Nothing fancy though.
# Programming
I'm currently building an obsidian plugin called Orgliner, which blends Outliner functionality with org mode. Coding this is a lot of fun, and I am using it myself daily, which gives me a lot of motivation to continue.

# Getting Fit Again
Somehow, I managed to gain a few kilos in the past months. They need to go down, so I am upping my movement and sports, and reducing my calorie intake. I hope it will be done within 2 months or so.
