# Family Life: Rush Hour
Back when I was 30, my brother told me that I was in the "rush hour of life", because many impactful things happened around  the same time: graduation, marriage, settling down, birth of the first child.

What is about to start these days is a different kind of rush hour. My parents, my wife's parents, their siblings and the respective spouses of my wife's parents are all at a very similar age, and they are all about to enter retirement, one way or the other. One has effectively been fired, but with a severance package big enough to amount to an early retirement. Another wanted to retire but discovered that they don't have enough money to do so just yet. And then, there are some for which my wife and I suspect that they didn't do any meaningful preparation in the first place.

On top of that, some of the aforementioned people are struggling with sickness, and then there is one person from the elder generation whose health is deteriorating quickly as well.

The next 5 years will be very busy for our families.

# Back to Paper
A couple of weeks back, I switched to a paper-based self organisation system, and I am amazed how well it continues to work. I was concerned that the bridge between online and offline would be a problem, but so far, it hasn't. On the contrary, working on paper means less distractions, and I am effectively getting way more done.

# Running
There are two races upcoming for me. I am not going to aim for any specific goal, reaching the goal would be nice, nothing more. One of them is the great Münster Marathon. Same as last year, I will run 20k - two consecutive parts of a relay race - there.
