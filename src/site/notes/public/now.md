# My Second Half-Marathon
Since the last update, I have successfully participated in my second-ever half marathon. I crushed my previous personal best and could have been even faster (a bit at least!), so I am very pleased with the result. 

I don't wish to complain, but I noticed one thing: After my first half-marathon, friends and family were congratulating me a lot on this performance, which I loved! But after the second one, the reaction was luke-warm. Weird, when you think about it, but then again also understandaeable.

# Work Life
I now lead two teams again, both of them are growing, so I have a lot to do. It's still sparking joy, though I really need to train my Delegation Muscle more.

# Family Life
The birthday of my 2nd daugher is ahead of us. I am looking forward to it. Also, I am going to have a night out with my most favorite human, and I am really looking forward to it.
We also now have pets: Both kids are proud moms of an assorted collection of snails. The snails seem to like it a lot as well, though I feel somewhat sorry for them. 

# Programming
I am dabbling with Obsidian Plugins these days. The thing is, I want to use Obsidian like an outliner, but all the plugins and built-in functionality have annoying restrictions. My current plan is to create one plugin that helps me get rid of at least 2-3 other plugins, and then improve on the functionality of the functionality taken from these plugins, and on top of that, build more stuff. 
Most of this sounds doeable, and I learn a lot about CommonMark in the process.
