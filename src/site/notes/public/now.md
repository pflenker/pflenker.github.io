# Family Life
The kids are on vacation, which is great for them, but also a bit stressful for us parents because of the unpredictable vacation schedule. I myself have 4 more days to work ahead of me, and then we're off to Denmark for our summer vacation!

# Programming
In the past weeks, I vibe-coded Orgliner, a mix of org-mode and outliner capabilities for Obsidian. Not only did I learn a lot about Obsidian, I also tried vibe-coding, and I have to say that the overall result is disappointing. There was more rework needed than LLMs saved time for me. I now lost interest in either and have archived the project.

# Productivity
I've taken a closer look at more modern apps and concepts which have entered the productivity space: [Twos](https://www.twosapp.com/), [Reflect](https://reflect.app/) and more. For now, I returned to [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) for my own personal todo/task management, hoping it will be a better choice than [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), which is my go-to backup because it's so reliable, but which I always ditch after several months because it hasn't been meaningfully updated in years.
