This is where I bury my Pet Projects.

Among family and friends, I've been known to come up with revolutionary ideas and projects, hyping everyone up about them and then silently burying them again.

I've made my peace now with the fact that I'd probably need better ideas, or at least more persistence, to actually change the world. The least I can do, though, is properly bury my ideas, which is what I'm doing here.
