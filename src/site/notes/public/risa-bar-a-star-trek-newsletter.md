It's time to finally bury another pet project: Risa Bar, a newsletter around Star Trek.

Risa Bar was named after an older pet project, which was also star trek-themed. The motivation was to play around a bit with Substack, around the time Twitter started imploding and Substack offered itself as an alternative.

It was a fun experiment. For each entry, I would thoroughly review one or two Star Trek episodes and provide extra background information. At the same time, I saw people joining, settling into and eventually leaving Substack. I am still subscribed to one or two substacks, but I can't really say I ever read them.

Also, I switched from using a cross trainer to going outside running, which is why I no longer have time to frequently re-watch old episodes.

So long, Risa Bar! ðŸ––
