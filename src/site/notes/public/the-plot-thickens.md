After I published how [[public/my-dad-buried-things\|My Dad Buried Things]], my friends did some extensive research around the junk yard (they did 2 min of googling) and found out that the cult advertisement was conceived in 1994.

The main story must have happened around the same time.

I reached out to them and asked if they can remember what sparked the idea of making a man burying a car the focus of their spot.  Let’s see how they react.

Dad, by the way, wants everyone to forget about this. His stance is that he never wanted to bury the cars, but he put them there because you are not allowed to place defunct cars at the curb. He said the press invented the part with the burying.
He still didn’t offer an explanation about all the other things.
