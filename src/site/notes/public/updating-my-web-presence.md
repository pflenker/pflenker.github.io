It's been long overdue that I updated my place on the internet.

Here's what I did:
- [philippflenker.com](https://philippflenker.com) now shows a profile page about me instead of my blog.
- I'm experimenting with [status.lol](https://status.lol/) as a way to post about what I'm doing currently, without getting dragged into social media rage mechanics.
- I've updated [my /now page](https://philippflenker.com/now) and plan to update it around once every two weeks.
- I archived [my old blog](https://archive.flenker.blog) and moved every longer article to [my new blog](https://flenker.blog). I hope to write more now, around 1-2 blog posts per month.

The big mindset shift behind this is that I used to regard my web presence as a platform to advertise myself, since I've done the last major overhaul because I was starting to look for a new job. As a consequence, many entries from that time era couldn't help but point out how awesome I am (something I've edited out of most of the articles while migrating them).

Nowadays, it's much more about carving out my own tiny corner of the internet (again) with no concrete goal or ambition.

Welcome, I'm happy you're here!
